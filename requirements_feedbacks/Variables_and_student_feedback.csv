CT,"Complex T-Units
(include dependent clauses)",Text.hypotaxis.count(CT),"The number of sentences containing finite dependent clauses in the text such as verb-controlled
that complement clause : “I think that it is a good book” and wh- complement clauses : “You told me what I wanted to hear”
as well as finite relative clauses : “I like the book which is on the table” .
Note that Biber (1999) shows that grammatical complexity varies in relation to clause structures and also noun phrase structures.

DC/C,"Number of finite clauses
relative to the number of clauses",Clause.hypotaxis.ratio(DC),"The rate of finite clauses compared to the number of all types of clauses (subordinated or not).
It gives an idea of the level of hypotaxis relative to the number of clauses.
The higher the more syntactically complex the text is. 
However it is not the only indicator of syntactic complexity. 
Non-finite clauses can also be used as well as complex noun phrases.

relative to the number of sentences",Sentence.hypotaxis.ratio(DC),"The rate of finite clauses compared to the number of all the sentences in the text.

The higher it is the higher proficiency tend to be.
