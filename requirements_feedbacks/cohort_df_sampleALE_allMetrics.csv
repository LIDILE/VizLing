14002475,"<p>In this written expression, I shall talk about mushrooms, and the fact that pharmacists are supposed to be able to recognise various species when they are presented to them. I will start by talking about mushrooms as organisms, before presenting mushroom gathering in the forest, and the risks involved in poor mushroom identification prior to consumption.<br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Mushrooms actually come as two forms, a microscopic form and a macroscopic form, that we can see, collect and eat. The microscopic form exists all year long, but we cannot see it. It feeds off decaying plants, like wood and leaves. In Autumn, this microscopic form develops into the stool shaped fruit gatherers collect in the forest. This fruit is in fact there to disseminate spores of the mushroom around the place. We can see the spores under the hat of the mushroom, and they are supposed to be spread around the forest by the wind to give birth to new microscopic mushrooms elsewhere.</p><br /><p>The best period of the year to go looking for mushrooms is in Autumn, after periods of heavy rain, that are very favorable to the growth of mushrooms. The vast majority of interesting mushrooms you can find live in the forest. On a good year, you can find mushrooms from september to january, but sometimes the weather is really good (which means it is bad for mushrooms) and mushrooms will be far more scarse.</p><p><br /></p><p>Any mushroom is said to be toxic if it isn't properly cooked. Some mushrooms that are considered to be edible can provoke stomach aches or diarrhea to certain people, that are too sensitive or that eat too much mushrooms at once. However, if you know you tolerate mushrooms well, there is no reason for you to suddenly become allergic to them. Other than poor tolerance or allergies, mushroom toxicity can be quite severe if ever you don't identify the specie properly and end up eating a mushroom that you believed was edible, despite it being violently poisonous. The main risk in mushroom consumption lies in identification errors. People that gather too many mushrooms too fast are the most exposed to this risk, because they won't necessarily check to see if a toxic mushroom is hidden among similar edible mushrooms in their basket.<br /></p>","12","French","<p>I think it is a true asset to pharmacists to be recognised as being able to identify mushrooms properly, however it turns out that despite our studies, qualified pharmacists aren't always that well informed about the edibility of a certain common mushrooms. On one hand its a shame that pharmacists can't identify mushrooms that well, and on the other its understandable that they are only exposed to mushrooms one season a year, which doesn't help to maintain knowledge about the subject.<br /></p>","Pharmacie","Oui","50",12,30,7,"Non","1995","M1","23","Anglais","C1","hebdomadaire","M","Sean Guegan","14002475","sean.guegan@etudiant.univ-rennes1.fr","lundi 8 octobre 2018, 16:00","lundi 8 octobre 2018, 16:00","","C2"

<p>The transposable elements (TE, or more commonly called transposons)
are mobile DNA sequences of variable length. The structure of a transposon is as
follows : a central sequence is delimited at each side by repeated (identical) sequences.
They can be classified into two main classes regarding the nature of those repeated
sequences : (1) the DNA transposons which are delimited by terminal sequences orientated towards the same direction, and (2) the retrotransposons, for which the terminal sequences face each other. The difference between the DNA transposons and the retrotranposons also resides in the way they move in the genome. While the first ones move following a cut-and-paste process, the second ones are transfered to other regions of the genome following a copy-and-paste process.</p><p>The TEs can also be distinguished based on the content of their central sequence, which conditions their ability to move autonomously or not from their initial locus to a new one.</p><p><br /></p><br />","11","French","<p>The discovery of the TEs in the maize genome by Barbara McClintock represents a great step forward into understanding the structure and dynamic dimension of the genome.

Indeed, the TEs make up for 50% of the human genome, and can represent up to 85 % of the big genomes of cereals. </p><p>Moreover, the dynamism of the TEs has surely played (and will keep playing) a great role in the evolution of species.

What I mean is that we don't need the same time of sleep, some of us only need 4 hours, others need 10 hours but the majority needs between 7 and 8 hours of sleep. That is what is advised by the authorities. Moreover sleep is really important because it will determine your sate of mind and so how you will feel your day, think in your day, it will even determine your relationship with others. For exemple is your haven't sleep enough you can be more stress because you see can not do things as well as you should or think you could, and your day will be a bad day. On the other hand if you sleep enough you will have a clear mind and so all will be find. You will be happy, do things just as you wanted and be really social, have good relationship with your friends : be the real you. <p>However people seems not to care enough about there sleep, they don't see that it can't deteriorate their health. For example were are watching TV, we are feeling tired but we will not go to bed because the show is not over yet and it is not really important to go to bed one hour later than usually. If we usually do that, in a long term, we will have debts of sleep. And our body make us understand. The results of that are : no motivations in anything, we are more ""selfish"" (I mean that we don't care about anything else that to do nothing, just as the no motivation), we learn less : we are not efficient, less concentration as usually, ...

There is applications or devices which can help us. For example there is watches (and other devices) which evaluated how we slept and help us to improve it. Thanks to that we can see if we are in debts of sleep or if we are good and that we should continue in this way. Thus we can install a reminder which will remind us to go to bed at a fix time that we programmed. It would help us to have a ""routine"" and sleep faster than usually.

16003228,"<p>Unit tests frameworks have been created in order to help developpers finding bugs. When you are writing some code, you always have to make sure that you didn't make a mistake. To prevent mistakes and bugs, you can test your program with some specific inputs in order to see if you program responds correctly for a given value.</p><p>A unit test is a function that tests a small portion of your code. Some 
frameworks (like Google Tests, Junit) brings you a set of useful test 
functions. For exemple, the most well known test function is 'assert'. 
For a strongly typed language (such as Java or C++), the framework has 
an assert function for each primitive types. If your function should 
throw an exception, a framework's function can catch it or alert you if 
the exception did not happen.<br /></p><p>Unit tests are written in a file which is integrated with the project : it means that they should not be removed at the end of the developpement, even if the project is terminated. It could be benefit for other developers which may find your code some years later and read your tests in order to see how your software is working.</p><p>Adding a new functionality to jour project which uses some tested function is easier.

It is fairly new and the vast majority of people don’t really know about it. Blockchain is the main technology behind most of the cryptocurrency that are built today. </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>What is a crypto currency you may ask ? Well you certainly may have heard about bitcoin, now or before (and you will certainly heard about in the years coming). Bitcoin is the first crypto currency based on the blockchain technology that was created by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008. </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It seems quite incredible, but before bitcoin we didn’t have « virtual money ». We didn’t know how to send money from one person to another. From a point A to B. And that’s what bitcoin does. The great thing is there is no need to go through an intermediate like banks or government. The bitcoin network is truly decentralized which means that at least you take control of all the computers on earth, no government can shut it off. </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Bitcoin first solved a main problem in the computer science field named « Byzantine fault tolerance ». It is basically solving trust issues. How do you trust a system knowing that people will maybe try to lie to you ? </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In the Byzantine problem, we have commanders outside of a city, that they must overtake. The commanders can only communicate oraly or by sending message to each other. But the problem is the messengers can lie. So how do you make a satisfeasible plan, knowing that some may lies ? </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Bitcoin solved this problem by creating the blockchain, a very big register where all the transaction are listed. And with the miners(people who uses computer to power the bitcoin network) all the transactions made on the network are verified. So there can be no fake transaction. </p><br />","15","French","There will be real consequences in the real world. Well bitcoin is the first of it's kind and has many drawbacks. It's like the myspace of social network or the emule of p2p. Cool but sadly determined to disappear. <p><br /></p><p>Bitcoin was started on 2008. And to verify the big register file of all transactions, there are miners that use their computer hashpower to resolve problems and run the network. This is called the proof of work. The problem is we didn't know it will be so successful and bitcoin consume a LOT of energy/electricity. If the network was a country it would be the 42th country, that consume the most electricity right between czech republic and switzerland. </p><p><br /></p><p>This is a great drawback and people are trying to find alternative. The another drawback is that if someone controls 51% of the network mining power, it is theoricaly possible to corrupt the network and create false transactions. So literally creating bitcoin ""out of nowhere"". </p><p><br /></p><p>If we want to be truly visionary we can imagine a future where fiat money(dollar, euro) will disappear and let the place to crypto currency. It might take 10-20 years maybe, but it is definitively possible. The proof of work, which is one of the main problem will soon be solved by the proof of stake concept which is more efficient and cost less energy. </p><p><br /></p><p>Children(!) in sweden, norway or even israel are already familiarised with cryptocurrency and they no longer ask for money at christmas but for bitcoin or other cryptocurrency. </p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p>","Informatique et electronique","Oui","0",0,0,5,"Non","1997","L3","21","Anglais","C1","quotidienne","M","Abrar Khan","16021826","abrar.khan@etudiant.univ-rennes1.fr","vendredi 16 novembre 2018, 09:58","vendredi 23 novembre 2018, 09:30","","B1"

Aspirin synthesis</b>

<p>  The aspirin is a
medicine and its synthesis is important for the pharmaceutic
industry.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>  The mechanism of
this synthesis is quite simple but it require heat and light.</p>
<p>The first step is to
create a phenol with as reactive a benzene. The phenol is a benzene
who has an alcohol function on one of its carbon. This reaction is
hard so we need to synthesis the cumene first and then we had the
phenol. The step two is an aromatic electrophil substitution between
the phenol and a dibrom. Then we use magnesium, carbon dioxide and
water and the product of these multiple addition is a benzene who had
an alcohol function and a carboxylic acid function on two of its
carbon.  This reaction take place in an acid space. 
</p>
<p>With these steps we
have synthesized the salicylic acid.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p align=""left"">  The
last step of this synthesis is the reaction between the salicylic
acid and an ester (the acetic anhydride). For this reaction, we put
both of the reactive in a balloon and we heat the balloon at the
temperature of 55 °C. When we heated the solution, there is a gaze
formation and we used a reflux heater for transform the vapor in
liquid. Then we put the balloon on the ice and we filter the product.</p>
<p>The last manoeuvre
is purification and for that we put with the product ethanol and
water. After we heat again and we filter the melange. The final
product is a white powder who is called aspirin.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>  The aspirin is
used in our everyday life’s. You can take it when you had a
headache or a stomachache or when you are in physical pain and you
need to feel a little better.</p>
<p>This medicine is an
inhibitor molecule and its replace the nor-adrenaline in the synapse.

pain free for couple hour.

Actually, it has been proved that some engrams that were created at the same time by the brain were then associated even if the two elements have nothing in common. </p><p>For example, if a patient sees a black cat in the street, he creates a cat-associed engram, but if he is then shot by a car, then the accident engram will be instantly associed to the black cat in its brain : the patient will then be scared of being shot if he sees a black cat again. </p><p>We can by the way transfer this idea to violent comportments at the adult time against children.</p><p>Actually, most of sick parents that violently abuse of their children were theirselves abused in their childhood. We can think that their engram of love and family is associed to the engram of violence and so when they have their own baby their engrams active them each others and that creates mental disorders and explains in a way their comportment. </p><p><br /></p>","11","French","<p>This discovery in the neurology domain is a great thing that permits once again to understand better the complicated organ that is the brain. </p><p>The understanding of the engrams and the possibility to control them allow new ideas of therapy in case of mental disorder. </p><p>But it is important to highlight the fact that this discovery is really new and that controlling the brain is not easy to do and can have many side effects that could be terrible.</p><p>Actually, we have to understand that sometimes human people can not go through anything and that all the diseases are not curable.  The idea of becoming more and more powerfull on our own body can lead to serious problems and all the experiences have to be realized in normal conditions always respecting patients in an ethical way. </p><p>If we respect these points, I think that it is amazing to be each day more alert about the brain fonctionment and that it will lead to new therapies that will make some serious diseases less hard, less painfull, and that will make some patient's lifes better.</p><p>Actually, brain diseases are terrible, sometimes coming suddently without any previous symptom and ruin people's life by making them uncapable of walking, talking, sometimes respirating...</p><p>They are diseases that scare many people but that can be sometimes cured and we have to encourage that. </p>","Médecine","Oui","0",0,0,3,"Non","1998","L3","19","Anglais","B2","hebdomadaire","F","Enna Le Bras","17002573","enna.le-bras@etudiant.univ-rennes1.fr","mercredi 24 octobre 2018, 12:20","mercredi 24 octobre 2018, 12:20","","B1"

Today the last “episode” is the 6th one.</p><br /><p dir=""ltr"">Now we will describe how the game actually work. To begin, you have to know than it’s a strategic turn per turn game. That means than it is a bit like a chess game, but with many many more options. When you start a new game, you have to choose the game parameters, like the leader you are going to incarne, the type of map or the difficulty of the AIs. Each leader is a historical leader who had made his or her name unforgettable, for example you can be : Elizabeth the first, Napoleon, Nobunaga Oda, Shaka Zulu, Pacal, etc etc… They all have their unique abilities, military unit and batiment. After having set the parameters you can really enter the game, at the beginning you only have a warrior unit and a steller unit. With you steller you have to create your first city witch is going to be your capital. With a city you can start technologie recherche, cultural expansion, build units or batiments. Then you can reach the victory by five differents ways, military by capturing all the capitals of the others players/AIs, technologie by being the first to send humans to Alpha Centauri, cultural by being so attractive than all the others countries citizens adopt your way of life, diplomatic by being elected world leader at the ONU, points but it is boring and can be desactivated.</p><br /><p dir=""ltr"">To make it more consistent : in this game you have to lead your people and your country throw the ages to make them survive and prosper, and become the most important nation in the world.</p><p><br /></p>","9","French","<p> The game I just talk about probably didn’t had any consequences at the international stage.

For example the leader of Carthage is Didon and her special unit is the war elephant you can also walk throw mountains as when Hannibal crossed the Alps to invade Rome.

again the patient to operate another time. </p>

the other hand, anapath can also reserch specific proteins to

brings a pronostic. Now a patient can recieve a treatment if we know

Nature gives us the possibility to reproduce ourselves, but we found a way to introduce science in the reproduction syste for those who have diseases. Science can offer the possibility for sterile people to have children, but how is it possible? I will take the example of the test tube baby.</p><p>For the test tube baby, we collect spermatozoons from the male body, and ovums from the female body. We put the ovum on a flat surface and the spermatozooms around, and let the processus happens by itself. The spermatozooms will meet naturally the ovum and only one will penetrate inside it. The fecondation will start. Then, you transplant the embryo in the female uterus ; the pregnancy may start. </p><p>It takes 9 months as every woman, and a baby is born at the end, with no aftereffect. The first test tube baby was born 40 years ago, Louise Brown. She is still alive and feels extremely good, as every human in good health. </p><p>But to give birth in general, we have many solutions, some are ethically correct, others are not. For instance, we can introduce spermatozooms directly in the uterus of the female without taking ovums from her. The test tube baby is for women who have problems with their fallopian tubes. </p>","10","French","<p>But the question of giving an opportunity for sterile people to have baby in a such easy way creates debates within the population. </p><p>Some people think it is a good thing to help these people.

And it goes against nature to give birth so easily, against the process of reproduction which is the basis of nature. And it causes a problem about the child that is about to born : during the experiment, is he a human already, or not? How should we consider him? </p><p>We are now able to freeze embryo and can use them after a long amount a time. But is it really ethic? Same question : is the embryo a human or not? And if one of the parents die, how do we have to consider it? Is it still the other parent's possession? </p><p>Giving birth with science is a wonderful thing that may help thousands of couples who suffer from sterility, but it causes numbers of ethic problems, and I think we should never consider this as a acquired discovery ;it is new and we should be careful about it.</p>","Medecine","Oui","6",2,5,8,"Oui","1998","L2","20","Anglais","B2","hebdomadaire","M","Augustin Ducasse","17008489","augustin.ducasse@etudiant.univ-rennes1.fr","mardi 9 avril 2019, 12:09","mardi 9 avril 2019, 12:09","","B1"

</p><p><a></a>Last year, during my
seconde year of medicine, I worked on this subject with friends for
an exam and I learnt a lot of informations. Before the law applied on
the first of january 2018, the number of obligatory vaccinations were
3, others were just recommended. We fount studies about that we call
""vacination cover"" and saw that if a vacination is not
obligatory, people think that is not for a ""dangerous""
disease and don't want to receive the vaccin. With the other students
we searched about what is happening in the other countries. In Sweden
for exemple, people trust a lot in their doctor and don't put in
reflexion what the doctor say. So, eerybody want to be vaccinaned for
all vaccin, even thoses which are not obligatory. In France, we know
that people are a bit suspicious about their doctor and there is a
lack of information about vacination. So the law was the only
solution, even if it's complicate in our society to oblige people to
do something.

18000512,"<p></p><p></p><p>Let me whrite about
an experiment which was realized years ago. This experiment is about
the duality of the light which can act like a particle or a wave.
Until the discovery of this duality, people did not understand the
way light behaved. This experiment and the results the scientist
observed made possible the comprehension of some phenomenon related
to the light. 
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>First, we can talk
about the experiment which was made. This experiment some scientist
realized was Young’s. It was a really simple experiment because
they just made light going through two little gap and they observed
that the light did not behave as expected. Also, the two gap were
separated by a larger space (if they had not, the experiment would
not had worked). Besides, the two gap needed to be really tiny to not
let pass to much light or it would not had been possible to observed
anything. Scientist discovering that light could comport as waves or
particles was a really big step ahead to understand a lot of
observations made in the past which were impossible to even believe
because light has in the same time properties of waves and particles.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>After they made this
experiment, they observed a spectrum designed on the screen behind
which one was created by interferences. Some of these interferences
were called constructive and others, on the opposite, destructive
because the first one permitted to see the light on the screen when
the second kind of interferences let a black screen. These
interferences are observed because of the difference of vibration
between two « wave » of light when it goes through the
different gap because after, there are two part of light which can
interfere.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In conclusion, we
can say that there are no direct applications of this discovery but
it permitted to understand better the way that light was acting and
also a lot of phenomenon which are linked to the way that light
behave.</p><br />","10","French","<p></p><p>In my opinion, there
are no direct applications of the discovery of the wave-particle
duality but, it permitted understand how light was acting and, this
can be used to define and explain a lot of things which can be useful
and used in every day life. Maybe it is not the most useful discovery
human made but, it is one of the most important anyway. Besides, that
is possible that in the future, this discovery will be used to make
something useful for every day life.</p><p></p><p>We made this
experiment in class, Young’s, to see the same phenomenon scientist
observed and then, we talked about the different kind of
interferences. I do not think it was very useful to make this
experiment except to see what scientist did in the past and why, in
the first place, they did not understand what they observed because
they did not know about this duality. But, because there
are no direct applications of this discovery, we did not see anything
about what we could do with this so, I think that is why I do not
believe that, for now, it is really useful.<br /></p><br /><br />","Sciences et proprietes de la matiere","Oui","1",0.25,1,1.5,"Non","1999","L2","20","Anglais","B1","jamais","F","Karine Lemaitre","18000512","karine.lemaitre.1@etudiant.univ-rennes1.fr","vendredi 22 mars 2019, 12:53","vendredi 22 mars 2019, 12:53","","B1"

These drugs used are normally prescribed to people suffering from ADHD, narcolepsy or even dementia.

It has even been proven that they could impair  rather than boost mental performance. </p><p><br /></p><p>Secondly, smart pills have many side effects. Amongst those are seizures, loss of appetite, depression and many more. One of the worst ones is addiction. In fact, students using smart drugs are more likely to use other highly addictive and illicit drugs. It is very hard for students using those brain enhancers to withdraw them and most of them need help ffrom doctors to do so. Moreover one of the major risks of smart drugs is intercations since most students buy smart pilss illegaly and thus get no supervision form doctors. SInce they have no supervision, most of them are not aware that for instance alcohol and contraceptives cannot be taken with those smart pills. Since people taking brain enhancers are mostly students, they are very likely to be taking alcohol regularly as well as contraceptives. Finally, insomnia is a long term side effect of these drugs. Since the brain consolidates memories, creates new brain cells and cleans toxins away during our sleep, insomnia is derimental to brain health. </p>","10","French","<p>I think smart pills are very dangerous because of all the side effects they can cause.

of energy has always been a key idea in physics and is now teach
practical classes of physics. An experiment to understood this
abstract concept is the analysis of light using diffraction. It is
based on the fact that lights rays are emit by atoms when they
desexcites, liberating energy. It goes to a final quantum state of
energy from an initial quantum state and free energy under the form
of a particle of photon, which is a no mass particle. 
</p>
<p lang=""en-us"" xml:lang=""en-us"">The
purpose of the experiment is to use the diffraction of the light
emits by a hydrogen luminescent tube to find the quantification
states of the hydrogen atom for each quantum number. This technique
involve a goniometer, which is a device that diffract light with a
network and then gives us the angular diffraction of fundamental rays
of this particular light. Furthermore the atoms are excite by an
electrical field, it passes in the tube filled with gaze of the
element we are working on and by giving energy to them as so
detestation appears as they cannot stay excite.</p>

to start on the hydrogen state of energy we need to find a crucial
parameter: the number of string of the network that diffract the
light. So we know the light rays he emits by the mercury element and
can retrace their wave length, we are using a mercury luminescent
tube to determine the parameter. Thanks to a physical formula
including this wave length, the number of string and the sinus of the
angle of the diffracted light obtained by the goniometer, we are able
to approach this number and continue the experiment.</p>

second time, we replace the mercury tube by a hydrogen one and repeat
the process through the goniometer. At this time we are just able to
pick up the values of the angle of the rays and using the same
formula as the first part of this experiment we can calculate the
final wave length.

<p>Weight plays a very important role in the aerodynamics of an airplane: if the aircraft is too “heavy”, it would require more energy, therefore more fuel, in the more demanding phase of a flight: the takeoff.</p>
<p>Thanks to the advanced technology and the work of brilliant engineers all over the world, the aircraft industry was able to find a way of developing “mixes” of different elements in order to obtain different properties from different materials. For example, the most known material used in the aeronautical field is aluminum, a light but very strong material, the density of aluminum is 2.7, as in it is 2.7 times more dense than water. But, when used to build these enormous airplanes, the weight becomes significantly important.</p>
<p>Which is why, engineers started to develop composite materials. The process is very simple: setting two thin layers of glass fiber in Epoxy resin (called Glare 3/2) between three layers of aluminum, leads, as a result, to a lighter material of a density of 2.34.</p>
<p>This is one of the many ways engineers of companies like Boeing are able to improve the characteristics of aircrafts. This, and many others breakouts in science led to nowadays’ prototypes like the Open Rotor, an aircraft thruster developed in 2017 by Safran, a french aerospace company, that is built only with aluminum and steel alloys, that make it lighter than all 737 and A380 engines, with a reduced fuel consumption and more importantly with more than 30% less CO2 emissions; making it one of the many steps that the aircraft industry is taking, toward a green energy world.</p><br />","14","Italian","<p></p><p>This project made me realize how much i am interested and invested in the engineering world.

transport takes a huge place in the international market and
globalization. That is why, industry of boats has increased a lot
these last decades. Many engineers work in order to improve the
performance of cargoes. The problem that they had to solve was
because of the contact between steel, sea and oxygen, it creates
oxidation. They created an anode, made of zinc, which protects the
steel. So, the question is: How this anode does it work?</p>
<p lang=""en-us"" xml:lang=""en-us""><br /></p>
<p lang=""en-us"" xml:lang=""en-us"">	First
of all, we have to have a look on the reactions. Steel is commonly
named with its atomic symbol: Fe. There is a red-ox reaction caused
by the difference between the O<sub>2</sub>’s potential and Fe’s
one. In that way, we have: Fe <U+2192> Fe<sup>2+ </sup>+ e<sup>- </sup>
and O<sub>2 </sub>+ H<sup>+</sup> + 4e<sup>-</sup> <U+2192> 2H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>
<p lang=""en-us"" xml:lang=""en-us"">Steel
is not still steel. It becomes ions. With O2, it is transformed in
Fe(OH)2, a red oxide. 
</p>
<p lang=""en-us"" xml:lang=""en-us""><br /></p>
<p lang=""en-us"" xml:lang=""en-us"">	Then,
the fact that sea water is salted, there are the ions: Na+ and Cl-.
They increase conduction and the share of electrons. Therefor,
oxidation of Fe becomes more important. 
</p>
<p lang=""en-us"" xml:lang=""en-us"">So, it
was necessary to find a way to reduce or stop this corrosion. 
</p>
<p lang=""en-us"" xml:lang=""en-us""><br /></p>
<p lang=""en-us"" xml:lang=""en-us"">	We
have seen that scientists invented the anode made of zinc. How does
it protect our steel?</p>
<p lang=""en-us"" xml:lang=""en-us"">Zinc
(Zn) has a smaller electric potential than Fe. Indeed, in red-ox, the
oxidant “attacks” the reduction which has the most negative
potential. Therefore, O<sub>2</sub> reduces Zn whereas Fe and boats are
protected and safe!</p>
<p lang=""en-us"" xml:lang=""en-us""><br /></p>
<p lang=""en-us"" xml:lang=""en-us""><br /></p>
<p lang=""en-us"" xml:lang=""en-us"">	To
conclude, steel is protected thanks to zinc because of their
difference of electric potentials. On order to avoid corrosion, a
piece of zinc is melted on the steel.</p><br />","11","French","<p> </p><p lang=""en-us"" xml:lang=""en-us""><sup></sup>According to me, the invention of the sacrificed anode had a
huge impact on the maritime market. Their life-during increased,
their maintenance price decreased. It favours globalization. 
</p>

with some accidents, such has recently the “crash” of America

we synthesize the two product of the main reaction. It consist of putting
together salisylic acid and acetic anhydrid in a balloon and we heat it to
around sixty degrees in a water bath during 30 minutes. Then, when all the
products are mixed together by heat, we put in on a filter; which is under

the acetylsalisylic acid (or aspirin) and acetic acid (which gives it smell to
vinegar). Our next step is to separate these two products to purify then later.
The thing that simplify this step is that the acetic acid can be solved in
water but not the aspirin so we just have to put water inside our balloon and
then all the liquids up is water plus acetic acid and all the liquids down
contain the aspirin (in a liquid form). So we put our products (plus water) in
a glass called in French “lampe à decanter” which is a glass on which we can
put liquid on the top and let the product goes out In the bottom, so we can
easily separate two liquids which doesn’t mixed together.</span></p>

<p><span lang=""en-gb"" xml:lang=""en-gb"">After the separation step, we purify the
aspirin by warm it again with a mix of ethanol and water. The mix will extract
from the aspirin the traces of water and products from the beginning, which
doesn’t react. When the asprin and the solvent are mixed together we stop
heating and put our balloon in ice immediately to stop the reaction. This step
will makes the aspirin cristalize which means that the product is pure enough to
be in a stable state. We just have to put the mix on the Buchner filter again
and take the cristals.</span></p>

talk about chemistry history.</p>
<p lang=""en-gb"" xml:lang=""en-gb"">By the
end of Middle-Age, Alchemistry was a wide spread trend. People
apprehended matter as divided into four categories (or elements),
distinct one from the others. They distinguished “water”,
“earth”, “fire”, and “air”. It was impossible to pass
from one to the other, unless we used what people called a
Philosopher Stone. Only this could allow you to turn something from
one element into an other. Obviously, everyone wanted to discover
this very special stone. In fact, it could not only transform silver
in gold, but it could also heal any illness. It was a very valuable
thing, but at the end, no one found the recipe and it became a
legend. Step by step, as scientists made experiments, alchemistry
slowly turned into what we now know as chemistry.</p>
<p lang=""en-gb"" xml:lang=""en-gb"">One of
the most famous experience that made alchemistry turn into chemistry
is the experience of the grown tree. A Dutch scientist had the idea
of putting a tree into a pot, and watering it. He started his
experiment, assuming that water was of the “water” element, and
the tree was of “earth” element since once it dies, it turns into
dirt. That being set, he measured the weight of dirt in the pot, the
weight of the tree itself and the amount of water he put everyday. I
can’t recall the exact numbers, but after 5 years, he stopped the
experiment, and measured again. The dirt in the pot was of almost the
same weight, he had used a lot of water, and the tree had grown a
lot, but not enough to meet with the weight of water used. He proved
thereby the existence of what he called “Sylvester gas”, and
destroyed the theory of matter divided into four elements. It was the
first step to discover Photosynthesis.</p>","13","French","<p>History is interesting, and discovering never stops.</p>","Sciences et proprietes de la matiere","Oui","9",2,1,20,"Non","1994","L2","24","Anglais","B2","quotidienne","M","Guillaume Dagry","18009199","guillaume.dagry@etudiant.univ-rennes1.fr","vendredi 22 mars 2019, 12:56","vendredi 22 mars 2019, 12:56","","C2"

new clone plant identical to the initial plant we used. First few weeks were
reading papers and finding informations about the experience, how scientists
already did it, even on another vegetable and how much time and money it costed.

created 6 culture medium with different concentration of hormones,
macroelements, microelements and vitamins. Then, we took some Onion’s
inflorescence and put it on the medium we made just after disinfected it. After
2 weeks of development, we were able to see cell clusters called

waited one month in the hope of obtaining a differentiation of the previously
obtained cells into tissues. After a few weeks, we could see buds. This was a

Flutter is available on all operating systems (Windows, Mac and Linux) and even on virtual machines (Visual Studio Code and Android Studio).<br /></p>","3","French","<p>It's a great innovation. Now, technology companies will no longer need to recruit android and ios developers  but rather a single developer who can use this tool to produce a robust application, powerful for the various terminals. The best part about flutter is that you have a wide range of widgets beautifully catalogued for you. Not only does it make it hassle-free but also helps you make a functionally amazing app. You use Dart language to write your Flutter app which is compiled to native code and generate ios and android version of your application. Google Flutter is a gift. Eye-catchy interface, faster app development process, flexible APIs  and few more features makes Google Flutter a mobile technology friendly tool.</p><p>The world of mobile development has just cognized a great revolution.<br /></p>","Informatique et electronique","Oui","4",1,1,2,"Non","1998","L3","20","Anglais","A2","mensuelle","M","Dodji Onesime Aguessy","oaguessy","onesime.aguessy@etudiant.univ-rennes1.fr","jeudi 22 novembre 2018, 23:48","vendredi 23 novembre 2018, 11:15","","C2"

Hundred years ago, people surely had doubted that this invention could have such impact on how the whole society functions, how we as people could interact with each other and how data could be processed and used to take decisions. There is no study field, from medecine to sport or finances, that doesn't require the use of a computer: either for a simple presentation, to financial predictions or to advanced data processing, it has become the main tool. The reason is pretty simple: computers do what people do faster and with a smaller ( or non-existant based on provided data and types of control that have been made) error rate.
