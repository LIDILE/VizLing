It use a ""helmet"" (lookslike a big pair of sunclasses) based on the 3D vision, each eyes see a differents images at the same to recreate the sensation of 3D vison. Some point of this technology is not perfect, the real problems is the different perception between internal ears and your vision. To be simple your body think you are poisoned, in fact your vision say at your brain your on movement but your ""internal ears"" don't detect any of it, and to figth again the poison you will throw. It's basicaly like the sea sike.<p>With this technology, the scientist can experiment some test they can't do normaly, they can create a virtual room with the rules of space to test that they want to test. It's the practical theory i thinks. Itcan remplace the real practice but it would help.</p><p>An other aspect oh this is in medical.

First, it has to learn what response to give in function of some inputs. For example if you make a algorithm for image detection and you want it to detect bird on pictures, you have to train it with thousand of pictures with and without bird, and tell him for each case if there is a bird or not on the picture.  After that, you can put any pictures you want in inputs, and it will be able to tell you there are birds or not on it. </p><p>This technology has already started to change the way company think a product.

cohort_student6,"<p>In this written expression, I shall talk about mushrooms, and the fact that pharmacists are supposed to be able to recognise various species when they are presented to them. I will start by talking about mushrooms as organisms, before presenting mushroom gathering in the forest, and the risks involved in poor mushroom identification prior to consumption.<br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Mushrooms actually come as two forms, a microscopic form and a macroscopic form, that we can see, collect and eat. The microscopic form exists all year long, but we cannot see it. It feeds off decaying plants, like wood and leaves. In Autumn, this microscopic form develops into the stool shaped fruit gatherers collect in the forest. This fruit is in fact there to disseminate spores of the mushroom around the place. We can see the spores under the hat of the mushroom, and they are supposed to be spread around the forest by the wind to give birth to new microscopic mushrooms elsewhere.</p><br /><p>The best period of the year to go looking for mushrooms is in Autumn, after periods of heavy rain, that are very favorable to the growth of mushrooms. The vast majority of interesting mushrooms you can find live in the forest. On a good year, you can find mushrooms from september to january, but sometimes the weather is really good (which means it is bad for mushrooms) and mushrooms will be far more scarse.</p><p><br /></p><p>Any mushroom is said to be toxic if it isn't properly cooked. Some mushrooms that are considered to be edible can provoke stomach aches or diarrhea to certain people, that are too sensitive or that eat too much mushrooms at once. However, if you know you tolerate mushrooms well, there is no reason for you to suddenly become allergic to them. Other than poor tolerance or allergies, mushroom toxicity can be quite severe if ever you don't identify the specie properly and end up eating a mushroom that you believed was edible, despite it being violently poisonous. The main risk in mushroom consumption lies in identification errors. People that gather too many mushrooms too fast are the most exposed to this risk, because they won't necessarily check to see if a toxic mushroom is hidden among similar edible mushrooms in their basket.<br /></p><p>I think it is a true asset to pharmacists to be recognised as being able to identify mushrooms properly, however it turns out that despite our studies, qualified pharmacists aren't always that well informed about the edibility of a certain common mushrooms. On one hand its a shame that pharmacists can't identify mushrooms that well, and on the other its understandable that they are only exposed to mushrooms one season a year, which doesn't help to maintain knowledge about the subject.<br /></p>",C2,0.665254237288136,0.925402901439534,10.2198295119947,7.22651075050184,31.8097090739623,0.910282997606288,147.22780810112,0.0105301117922827,0.091396685161551,0.177304660553649,5.79416303327188,13.341553426789,13.1259875619026,67.1029598065185,10.9212714499597,-4.39467802628123,218524566.958223,42.2808533916849,40.7983588621444,43.6831389496718,11.0945951952341,11.095579868709,25.1607958079005,8.5265127144996,7.40500380052977,6.59447719298246,83.6074596491228,-439.509312698376,539.467802628123,9,-54.929733962916,49.3200472187032,6.82692865369112,12.3555153748704,14.8726937694345,7.76359136201773,67.8918421052632,10.6126914660832,10.1039606126915,115.052631578947,12.6315789473684,48.5602902222734,7.98290196936543,8.49835941494875,7.35777948865599,8.29800476793735,5.89473684210526,1.67446125630445,13.2809165343631,12.8523518705323,12.7332852678458,7.73328526784575,6.2070051825406,6.99672302199701,11.3526315789474,-475.0696047426,-266.763514748359,90,24.0526315789474,1.57330415754923,464,19,72,48,26,23,14,7,48,24.4211,17.8462,9.6667,2.5263,2.7692,1.8462,0.4792,0.8846,1.3684,0.5385,0.2692,0.1458,1.8462,1,12,French,Pharmacie,Oui,50,12,30,7,Non,1995,M1,23,Anglais,C1,hebdomadaire,M

were the main pharmaceutical discovery of the pass century. For main peoples,
their discover is due to Pasteur, which, of course, is wrong. They were brought
into light by Alexander Fleming who accidentally discovered penicillin in 1928.
That was just the first step; the G penicillin he obtained was efficient but
not enough and could not be taken by oral way. As often in history the war needed
the improvement of science, and antibiotics have made no exceptions. They were
currently used during world war 2, whether in hospital or on the
battlefield.  They gave new ways of curing
diseases we could not hope to fight about twenty years before. More than penicillin,
other class appeared from then to nowadays, such as macrolids or ciclosporins… </span></p><br /><p>Antibiotics actually have changed the world of medecine for ever, but we need to be carefull with the way we use them.

He treated himself with Cinchona (reccomandations at the time in the treatment of Malaria) and found out that the symptoms were the same as those described by Cullen. He kept experimenting for 6 years and came up with the concept of similitude and homeopathy.

cohort_student15,"<p>I will talk about antibiotics. They were discovered in 1928 with the penicilium. They are the best solution, even today, against bacteria infection. It was a good discovery because antibiotics cure people from infection which sometimes killed patients. <br /></p><p>Today we developted a lot of antibiotics with a large spectrum of activity. But they can have some toxicity on the body like for example kidney toxicity. <br /></p><p>They helped a lot but today we use to much antibiotics in France. The problem is that bacterias can develop some adaptation and resistance angainst antibiotics. We used to much antibiotics and unfortunately today they are less efficace than before and bacterias are strongers. In France sometimes even if you have a viral infection doctors can give you some antibiotic, but it is not efficace. In Norway for example, they prescribe less antibiotics than in France but they are more efficace because bacterias did not develop the same resistance of the treatement as in France. <br /></p><p><br /></p><p>To conclude I think that antibiotics are a wonderfull discovery for the medecine but today in France we use it to much and we have to try to reasone and reduce the consommation of antibiotics. <br /></p>",B1,0.617021276595745,0.893722112505688,5.982243228301,4.23008475343894,18.5657421324385,0.834671752067313,289.723856948846,0.0185312285518188,0.108309770494354,0.232083274288154,3.93077467117528,9.05094316176675,10.0276153846154,60.8346153846154,8.82307692307693,-2.8702397478397,60867612.914946,44.2423076923077,45.5166666666667,42.1805123076923,11.5063209056431,11.5070769230769,24.5310897435897,9.13901282051282,7.67108461538462,6.11643092783505,81.0143907216495,-354.188804896907,387.02397478397,5.83333333333333,-46.98575,41.5320192307692,7.06468333333333,11.5033974358974,15.1153846153846,6.49166811538462,21.16875,10.3846153846154,9.85307692307692,80.5,14,44.4551282051282,8.36989743589744,8.99450641025641,8.36307115384615,8.53315384615385,4.58333333333333,1.67151767151767,13.8166696488959,13.3529051578271,13.2469507659596,8.2469507659596,5.10627564102564,5.73230128205128,8.575,-397.537470769231,-293.114415589744,58.3333333333333,16.25,1.75897435897436,195,12,28,23,18,6,6,3,18,16.25,10.8333,8.4783,1.9167,1.5556,1.2778,0.2609,0.3333,1.5,0.3333,0.1667,0.1304,1,0.7826,10,French,Pharmacie,Oui,16,4,7,2,Oui,1996,M1,22,Anglais,B2,mensuelle,F

cohort_student20,"<p>I will speak about esport. First of all, what ""esport"" meaning ? It's the competition on online games, ""e"" for electronic, ""sport"" because the way of thinking at those games are pretty much same as physic sport. It can be team play, or solo competitions. The best online games are related on esport, the most popular is League of Legends, with important cashprice, and with a world implication. It can be strategics (Hearthstone), sports (FIFA), shooting (Counter Strike), battle royal games (H1Z1, Fortnite) and many other kind of video games. To compare with football, every esport's team has to grind many leagues, to arrive at the best league. There is also worlds cup, to continue like the physics sports. To become better, it's like everything, you have to practice ! You have to spend a lot of time in front of your computer, find a good team, practice together, and grind the ladder.</p><p><br /></p><p>During years, esport's development is becoming more accurate. A lot of big companies is starting to invest on those team, like ""Orange"" in France or ""Red Bull"" for example. In people minds, it's developing aswell ! It's not anymore just a ""geek"" who's wasting his time on the internet, playing for fun, and who doesn't speak to anyone in real life. There are professional player, just as a professional player at a Football team. And I really think this is a good thing. It's like physical sport, you have to sacrifice some things to become professionnal. You practice, you get better, and you are rewarded, I really think it's a good balance. And for some game, professionnal are here since ten years, and it's a big challenge to be a part of them. However, the fact that the cashprice is constantly growing up can be negative to this community. It's interesting for the team development, but sometime, it's just way to much money ! For example, Fortnite. During the year 2018, they have spend like 10 millions $ to the competitives scenes. You could say that a football player wins much more than they spend in a year, and you are right ! But to me, it's too many money. I'm not saying they don't diserve this, but in comparison of time played, it's too many. As I sayed, they are professionnal and you have to be rewarded in differents ways. And I'm glad that their efforts are unnoticed.<br /></p>",B1,0.688118811881188,0.929582721599833,9.78000587175106,6.91550847195942,32.7384332627255,0.912575926726991,98.5197529653956,0.00492586572090045,0.0515531831434588,0.174771677234471,5.8137165229765,13.3865770006989,6.95536796536796,54.8701298701299,5.40865800865801,-2.4164113222315,36258693.2028824,53.4136363636364,55.1207070707071,52.3677404040404,8.71497965833131,8.71555555555555,37.2086002886003,7.16902106782107,6.18094761904762,5.33754506329114,85.2821493670886,-296.683282547117,341.64113222315,4.07142857142857,-44.7333181818182,69.6390909090909,5.50410620490621,7.05955266955267,10.6066378066378,5.02290381471861,33.4328571428571,9.31818181818182,8.68,64,7,32.5772005772006,5.15814531024531,5.89712655122655,5.24615266955267,5.45869639249639,2.60714285714286,1.64552661381653,10.6863529731378,10.4517594184299,10.2456883730947,5.24568837309472,4.31675036075036,4.874556998557,6.16071428571429,-335.476260526696,-247.515271919192,40.7142857142857,14.1428571428571,1.4520202020202,414,28,65,47,33,12,9,4,43,14.7857,12.5455,8.8085,1.6786,1.9697,1.4242,0.2553,0.3636,1.1786,0.2727,0.1212,0.0851,1.303,0.9149,9,French,Informatique et electronique,Oui,0,0,0,15,Oui,1996,L3,22,Anglais,B2,jamais,M
cohort_student21,"<p><b>The discovery of penicillin</b></p><p>Penicillin is one of the first antibiotics found. In 1928, Dr Ian Fleming forgot his Petri culture for two weks. After that delay, he observed a contamination by fungi from another Petri culture, which has been incubated at the same time. The fungi contamination has inhibated the developpement of bacterias. The fungi have produced a toxin, the penicillin, headed to the bacterias and their growth.<br /></p><p>The developpement of the product of the fungi Penicillium has lead to the production of it as a cure to some bacterial infection. The developpement was accelerated by the Second world war and the emergency of finding medications to treat soldier's infections. Within 4 years, the penicillin was synthetized and industrially produced in high quantities. <br /></p><p>For the following decades, the use of penicillin became a habit to every hospital and genral practitioners to provide strong bacterial infection such as pulmonar infection, septicemia etc. Following this discover, the scientists succeded to develop other families of antibiotics and optomized their production and therapeutical use.<br /></p><p><b>The consequences :</b> <br /></p><p>The discovery of penicillin is the first antibiotic to be found and developped extremely quickly. The production's capacities weren't as efficienty as it is now. It saved thousands of lifes, at the front during the WWII and after that, to treat epidemias, which devasted countries by that time. It saved thousands of lives and prevent injuries such as necrosis and general septicemia.<br /></p><p>The production of the penicillin is also cheap, so the cost is supportable even for in-developpement countries. The speckter of action is also large, with a three times-a-day administration. It is taken oraly, so it doesn't required a medical structure. It is really useful on the field, in region where the access to the health care system is not optimal. The statistics showed a significative link between the developpement and the use of penicillin and the inscreased of life rate in the world. <br /></p><p>With a worldwide and frequent use come side effects. One of the main consequences is the developpement of resistance from the bacteries. The antibiotic selects the resistant mutans and destroyed the rest of the population, which is provided the developpement of resistance. It slows down the efficient treatement of the specific bacteria and held to  difficulties of treating properly the patient.</p><p>As a conclusion to this discovery, it helps dealing with lethal diseases which were stricking a century ago, but the developpement of resistances from the bacteries led to apply protocoles to have a better use of antibiotics and adaptation to the resistance's mechanism.<br /></p>",B2,0.767123287671233,0.950806416447111,11.3523879571114,8.02735050713394,47.5762070133362,0.940676960648846,89.8646817205646,0.00444053453981819,0.0550825491392284,0.144978997511016,7.18338364483821,16.5403520978617,12.3454598465473,65.3629667519182,11.2477749360614,-3.33214791448417,95326040.5301225,38.6464705882353,39.3864705882353,35.8950214117647,13.2285705530908,13.2294588235294,19.5088235294118,9.82873938618926,8.2275631713555,6.67332879409352,78.8087816242822,-401.325179878955,433.214791448417,7.43478260869565,-49.3167971355499,32.6146240409207,7.59600281329923,13.3007570332481,17.2736572890026,7.40288621483376,57.1684782608696,11.0352941176471,10.5688235294118,96.2608695652174,18.2608695652174,49.772378516624,9.71004757033248,10.2303140664962,9.72606163682864,9.99412020460358,5.78260869565217,1.6565335753176,15.335164690038,14.7773704696699,14.7028424640824,9.70284246408241,6.11698721227622,6.82372890025575,10.1869565217391,-443.833394322251,-313.951125082353,74.3478260869565,18.4782608695652,1.83764705882353,430,24,44,33,27,6,6,15,56,17.9167,15.9259,13.0303,1.375,1.6296,1.2222,0.1818,0.2222,1.125,0.2222,0.5556,0.4545,2.0741,1.697,11,French,Pharmacie,Oui,3,3,5,7,Non,1997,M1,21,Anglais,C1,hebdomadaire,F

It's not very beautiful..  Aminoside is not recommended if you have some kidney problems. So, we can have very tragic toxicity (death), it is why antibiotics must be used with attention and prescribed by a specialist. <br /><br />Today, a lot of people use automedication and they don't know the risk of that.

In april 1961 Yuri Gagarine completed an entire orbit of the earth in his space module. We can say ""module"" because it barrely looked like a space shuttle.<br /><br />Thanks to the hard work of soviet scientists the impossible began possible.

cohort_student30,"<p>The microscope was invented back in the sixteenth century. While it was designed to be used to count threads in fabric, it has become a very important technology used widely in science. Its discovery has allowed mankind to see what had never been seen before : things so small the human eye was not able to distinguish. <br /></p><p>Discovering the structure of the cell was vital to understand most disease, that had nothing but empirical treatments before : by learning the changes the cells undergo during the disease, scientists were able to design drugs that have a specific action. </p><p>Moreover, the cause of most diseases were unknown before the discovery of bacteria, which happened thanks to the microscope. Doctors were then able to know what caused the disease, and even more importantly, to know how they spread. This crucial information helped to protect wide population groups of even getting sick, by spotting efficiently the source of outbreaks. For example, the bacteria causing cholera can be found in wells infected by human secretions. Protecting the water and getting rid of human fluids properly helped the outbreaks to stop, at least in developed countries. </p><p>Today, the microscope is also used as a mean of diagnosis : when people are infected, or have a serious disease of unknown cause, it is very easy to take a sample of body fluids, and use the microscope to look for any disturbance in the usual signs. Some fluorescent antibodies have even been developed : it helps spotting abnormalities in blood samples and biopsies.</p><p>Even now, the microscope industry is always trying to see tinier things : not so long ago, researchers were able to see a single atom thanks to an incredibly precise microscope. These microscopes are fundamental when it comes to research, and their use seems to be limitless.</p><p>The microscope is an amazing discovery, and I believe that while there are a lot of other ways to diagnose diseases, it is still crucial. Most infections (caused by bacteria, viruses or even parasites) use microscopical proof as their main mean of diagnosis, even nowadays. While biochemical tests are expending their ability, evidence from microscopical observation is still a very trusted method of diagnosis.</p><p> Microscopes are also very useful in research. It is very hard for the human brain to understand and trust theories without seeing the result of theses theories, and the microscope has exactly this function. Some concepts are very hard to comprehend without a visual depiction, especially for visual learners. Hence, the microscope helps the researchers to get a practical idea of the thing they are studying.<br /></p><p>Moreover, it is a very inexpensive mean to diagnose a lot of diseases, which has a very obvious benefit when it comes to socially shared health expenses. Reducing the cost of diagnosis is definitely needed in a time of economical crisis such as ours. </p><p>To conclude, I believe that the microscope is vital when it comes to both diagnosis and research in an economically efficient way, and it will most likely be used for a long time in the future. </p>",C2,0.711111111111111,0.939103092002092,11.6847478934435,8.26236447190916,39.9258984420441,0.929281498551759,78.1893004115226,0.00413052457662123,0.0510939987456348,0.158260542873057,6.64454336041433,15.2996264914426,12.8111554262239,66.4137281752824,10.9859637110579,-4.02139806308877,167504903.87535,38.2389763779528,37.7114173228346,41.0392133858268,11.8190413754299,11.82,23.1399212598425,8.9903398151318,7.69844481342006,6.61902462052997,82.0239624903525,-425.223348798357,502.139806308877,8.95652173913044,-52.984674255392,42.6950855871277,7.13761088668264,12.7912358781239,16.7087983567271,7.87980390879836,76.6878260869565,11.0826771653543,10.6209448818898,108.782608695652,17.3913043478261,49.8428620335501,9.32975015405683,9.80582923656282,8.92584238274564,9.57487045532352,6.1304347826087,1.64228617106315,15.0409994214226,14.5008523597542,14.4208048144032,9.42080481440322,5.97876583361862,6.72963882232112,11.1,-462.518895376583,-280.916019645669,89.5652173913043,22.0869565217391,1.6751968503937,508,23,78,50,29,20,14,8,63,22.087,17.5172,10.16,2.1739,2.6897,1.7241,0.4,0.6897,1.2609,0.4828,0.2759,0.16,2.1724,1.26,11,French,Pharmacie,Oui,3,1,4,15,Non,1996,M1,22,Anglais,C2,quotidienne,F
cohort_student31,"<p>Back in the days when people frequently died from infections and all sort of diseases caused by bacteria, some scientists searched day after day for solutions to prevent and kill bugs and superbugs when they infiltrated the human body. Alexander Fleming was one of those, his main topic of research was how to cure the infected wounds of soldiers. Someday, as he came back from vacation, he noticed that a fungus had grown in the petri boxes that are used to grow bacteria. Above all he noticed that the fungus killed all the bugs next to it. That fungus was Penicillium notatum, Fleming found out that it produces a antibiotic molecule which he named penicilin. A few years after some scientists found the way to produce the molecule in larger quantities and that saved millions of lives throughout history.<br /></p><p>The discovery of penicillin paved the way for the antibiotic research in the 20th century, it saved lives after scientists found how to produce the molecule in the needed quantities. Fleming remains as a strong example of the scientific mind, he turned a mistake, letting the bug cultures open when on vacation, into a huge and crucial discovery for mankind. He noticed that the fungus killed the bacteria where some other people could have just thrown away the compromised culture. In my opinion that's how someone who does scientific and pharmaceutical research should think. Moreover, thinking about Fleming's discovery and how he did it remains important, this is how students aknowledge that random is a part of science, and that's critical nowadays because of the emergence of the superbugs. Those multi-resistant bacteria are threatening lives and we need to find new antibiotics to efficiently fight them.<br /></p>",C2,0.755102040816326,0.943711816444409,9.15512569714978,6.47365146306983,38.5039487481014,0.925099966015,114.304225091397,0.00465939800577765,0.0492078601458212,0.161156328526765,6.18354240123281,14.2381325549753,13.7567016317016,68.2983682983683,11.77668997669,-4.36373261052116,213927172.893347,43.1898601398601,41.6723776223776,40.3513146853147,12.007528370965,12.0085314685315,21.3137412587413,9.18020675990676,7.87805128205128,6.81681210526316,81.9597289473684,-451.721346981352,536.373261052116,8.75,-54.6958787878788,44.7994114219114,7.0649696969697,12.9315734265734,16.6662004662005,8.16736778135198,44.7366666666667,10.506993006993,9.98769230769231,117.75,17,52.504662004662,9.07129696969697,9.65738904428904,8.70952132867133,9.53028018648019,6.83333333333333,1.70951704545455,14.9062281516336,14.3742492230148,14.2915897906362,9.29158979063621,6.35262354312354,7.14635314685315,11.65,-483.6034102331,-280.246220874126,87.5,23.8333333333333,1.62937062937063,289,12,46,36,13,19,9,5,34,24.0833,22.2308,8.0278,3,3.5385,2.7692,0.5278,1.4615,1.0833,0.6923,0.3846,0.1389,2.6154,0.9444,14,French,Pharmacie,Oui,1,0,0,10,Oui,1998,M1,20,Anglais,C1,quotidienne,M
cohort_student32,"<p>The discovery of antibiotics by Flemming in the XXth century is one of the most revolutionnary discovery of the last past century. Indeed, its commercialization in the 40's allows to eradicate a lot of diseases since World War 2. Unfortunately, nowadays we attend to a hudge development of antibiotics resistance probably due to the overuse and the misuse of these medications. Today, because of that matter, simple diseases or surgeries which could be treated easily by antibiotics before, can become very serious even lead to death sometimes. Thus, it is becoming now a real public health issue that we absolutely need to discuss and solve quickly. <br /></p><p>To my mind, we should stop overusing antibiotics otherwise we will not be able to treat simple illnesses in the future and consequences will be disastrous. <br /></p><p>Then, one of the solution can be to encourage doctors not to prescribe too much antibiotics when it is not necessary. That is why diagnosis should be easier to make at the GP's office in order to prescribe the good treatment which doesn't include antibiotics in the case of a virus for example. </p><p>Finally, I think that providing more prevention to patients is the key of the problem too. Indeed if the public is aware about how to use efficiently antibiotics, they will not overuse them, and then antibiotics resistances will reduce. </p>",B2,0.848214285714286,0.965111366096529,8.97665623396915,6.34745449542008,58.735977692332,0.950503352455171,149.872448979592,0.00611325611325611,0.0667901872170269,0.13048118700674,7.55318341816381,17.3918475433138,12.7001333333333,66.22,10.7466666666667,-4.09622913806133,176981529.051891,41.8166666666667,40.8055555555556,42.3962111111111,11.4472185707111,11.4481777777778,21.875,9.1737,7.8422,6.57159678571429,82.6086521428571,-431.523041694071,509.622913806133,8.5,-53.3595666666667,36.6055,7.47471111111111,13.7432222222222,17.1777777777778,8.06566433333333,34.1625,10.6666666666667,10.1633333333333,109.3,18.4,48.2777777777778,9.3046,9.86843333333333,9.22953888888889,9.89295555555556,5.8,1.63694852941176,15.381575749823,14.8210191780611,14.7473401244707,9.74734012447073,6.26061111111111,7.03105555555556,11.76,-461.508267555556,-272.042918533333,85,22.5,1.74222222222222,227,10,30,21,11,8,6,3,26,22.7,20.6364,10.8095,2.1,2.7273,1.9091,0.381,0.7273,1.1,0.5455,0.2727,0.1429,2.3636,1.2381,10,French,Pharmacie,Oui,14,3.5,6,2,Oui,1996,M1,22,Anglais,B1,mensuelle,F

Each day, i worked with his crew and i learned how to deliver medecines, to read order of GP and to speak with patients on the counter. Two weeks after start my stage, the pharmacist propose me to visit CERP which is a big enterprise in the pharmacy. It was a very good experience because i could meet a lot of people who work in my domain and after the visit of this warehouse, there was a conference about pharmacy's future with internet. <br /></p><p>before to start my stage, i was scared because i thinked that i was borring but after this experience, i could see that my studies it  was very interesting and complete. i could learn a lot of things and i could develop my skills and knowledges.

cohort_student38,"<p><b><u>TRANSPOSABLE ELEMENTS</u></b></p>

<p>The transposable elements (TE, or more commonly called transposons)
are mobile DNA sequences of variable length. The structure of a transposon is as
follows : a central sequence is delimited at each side by repeated (identical) sequences.
They can be classified into two main classes regarding the nature of those repeated
sequences : (1) the DNA transposons which are delimited by terminal sequences orientated towards the same direction, and (2) the retrotransposons, for which the terminal sequences face each other. The difference between the DNA transposons and the retrotranposons also resides in the way they move in the genome. While the first ones move following a cut-and-paste process, the second ones are transfered to other regions of the genome following a copy-and-paste process.</p><p>The TEs can also be distinguished based on the content of their central sequence, which conditions their ability to move autonomously or not from their initial locus to a new one.</p><p><br /></p><br /><p>The discovery of the TEs in the maize genome by Barbara McClintock represents a great step forward into understanding the structure and dynamic dimension of the genome. It allowed scientists to finally understand how some genomes, no matter how close they were related one to another, could differ so much in their size. Indeed, the TEs make up for 50% of the human genome, and can represent up to 85 % of the big genomes of cereals. </p><p>Moreover, the dynamism of the TEs has surely played (and will keep playing) a great role in the evolution of species. Due to their ability to insert themselves into a random genomic region, they indeed can alter or even unactivate genes.<br /></p><p><br /></p>",C1,0.73972602739726,0.939506582788677,8.93814359690557,6.32022194859105,35.7783202794387,0.919183106356019,123.850628635767,0.00557392536608408,0.0559088866309945,0.167182196278075,5.93646900844397,13.6692250438642,14.2774545454545,69.3454545454545,12.1636363636364,-4.58740727514081,248483200.09757,38.95,37.57,40.4250025454545,11.9873376025353,11.9883636363636,15.3136363636364,10.1015545454545,8.5792,6.9090900464499,82.196099535501,-465.083585434418,558.740727514081,10,-55.9326,37.4861818181818,7.48537272727273,14.2414545454545,18.8727272727273,8.90928090909091,48.125,11,10.53,123.181818181818,22.1818181818182,53.7272727272727,10.2572181818182,10.7707636363636,10.2205727272727,11.0336909090909,7.18181818181818,1.61156412157153,16.5819255565344,15.9517665997349,15.8982028346447,10.8982028346447,6.90436363636364,7.74145454545454,12.7636363636364,-499.119503272727,-283.164747090909,100,25,1.70181818181818,277,11,24,20,13,7,6,8,40,25.1818,21.3077,13.85,1.8182,1.8462,1.5385,0.35,0.5385,1.1818,0.4615,0.6154,0.4,3.0769,2,11,French,Sciences de la vie et de l'environnement,Oui,6,2,5,4,Oui,1996,M1,22,Anglais,C2,quotidienne,F

cohort_student43,"<p>I would like to share with you something I think it is very important concerning the development of human health. It is one of the biggest and greatest inventions of the medical world, something which change many people life. It is actually the HIV treatment.</p><p>Before this treatment, especially in Africa, people though that when you was HIV positive, this constituted the end of your life. There were a lot of misconceptions about that disease : the way to be contaminated, the number of years that a person who are HIV positive could live... </p><p>People with the virus did not have the support of their family, even not the support of the community. Life projet like marriage, find a good job, have a family or something very simple like live with others were not possible if the disease was there. </p><p>Many people had been killed not by the disease, but because of the lonelyness. One of the misconception were that, if you have skin contact with someone who live with the virus, you can get it.</p><p>Nowadays, thanks to the HIV treatment, things become to change. For example, we can see women or men with the disease make a family and get married,,and above all of that, they can have children and live normaly, the same way people without the virus do. This treatment are a real revolution. But many efforts have to be made again, espacially in countries which do not have a high level of life.</p><p><br /></p><p> <br /></p><p>This is a real progress.<br /></p>",B1,0.677966101694915,0.918532030434664,7.36459694318659,5.20755643923296,25.4318601330124,0.883344578379299,178.109738580868,0.00941619585687382,0.0728764286864193,0.198294622470898,4.81372582840784,11.0840133342523,8.49354037267081,57.9844720496894,6.43726708074534,-3.19213177537594,83775899.0389738,51.2891304347826,50.9353754940711,52.6493442687747,8.63781907297865,8.63857707509881,35.759963297572,7.15410767927724,6.26164844720497,5.56331904761905,86.4692952380952,-339.846212275551,419.213177537594,5.5,-48.747152173913,66.1067292490119,5.78527058159232,8.52821287408244,11.1811405985319,5.8346956443817,25.8782142857143,9.56521739130435,8.95173913043478,80.1428571428571,7.14285714285714,36.2532467532468,5.32108831168831,5.98836132128741,5.25607275550536,5.81823387916431,3.28571428571429,1.75579322638146,10.7630783206399,10.5219828015134,10.319250547114,5.319250547114,4.72548475437606,5.35861293054771,7.84285714285714,-373.5446183738,-232.3222343083,55,18.0714285714286,1.44664031620553,253,13,35,28,14,13,7,5,29,19.4615,18.0714,9.0357,2.1538,2.5,2,0.4643,0.9286,1.0769,0.5,0.3571,0.1786,2.0714,1.0357,12,French,Pharmacie,Oui,0,0,0,3,Non,1996,M1,22,Anglais,A2,mensuelle,F

cohort_student45,"<p>My 3rd year internship :</p><p><br /></p><p>I had to do 1 full week in a community pharmacy during my 3rd year. I also had to make a report about the dyslipidemias and how to treat them in a community pharmacy.</p><p>I did this intership in a little community pharmacy in the city center of Dinan with just one pharmacist. It was interresting but a bit long and i had some exams to work on for the week after so i talked to my pharmacist about it and she said that if i finished my report before friday i could go home earlier. <br /></p><p>So i spent the majority of my time working on that report and I didn't even go and speak with some patients because I was a bit in a hurry. <br /></p><p>The subject of the report was interresting but not that much because we had to go really deep in the subject and so it was a bit difficult and long. For example we had to comment a lot of prescriptions with all the details about every drug : Initial indication, mecanism of action, side effects, adn everything else. <br /></p><p>We also had to do like a therapeutical paper for the patients about one subject of our choice (still in dyslipidemias) so i did one about the risks of eating too much (especially about how it is impacting on the vessals, the bloodstream and the risks)  fat and how to change that, how to eat better, which products they have to avoid and which ones they have to prefer. <br /></p><p>At the end of the week we had to make a presentation at the pharmacist about a subject of our choice. So i did it about how the lipids can bloke the blood in the vessals and how this formation can ""explode"" and relieve some toxins, proteins adn other bad things int hte blood stream or even destroy the vessal. Obviously this ends really bad. So i also had to give some solutions about the way of live because that is how people can reduce the risk : Better food, exercise ... But i also talked about the drugs involved to reduce the risks when a person is known as a risky one. <br /></p><p>It hink this internship is a good idea at first but finally not that much when some exams are planned juste after because we just want to end it up quickly to be able to work on our exams.

However, he saw that children working with cows were not as much affected by the disease, they only got one little pustule. Therefore, he took what was inside this unique pustule, and injected it in a baby's arm.

cohort_student48,"vaccination principle is to  innoculate to someone viruses or bacteria in order to protect this person against these germs. <br />It has been discovered in england during the 19th century by a doctor which had pointed out that farmer's children didn't catch chickenpox. He understood that these children had caught a less aggressive form of the virus which normally infect cattle and had developped antibodies against it. Then, when they were in contact with the real chickenpox virus, their antibodies were already prepared and the virus couldn't infect them.<br />From this observation, he begun to innoculate all children with this cow's virus and it worked : they didn't catch chickenpox<br />Today, vaccination is much less archaic. We use deactivated virus and bacteria, or even just their envelop, to ensure that we are not ill after the injection. There are additives in some vaccines to stimulate immunitary system to create antibodies. Sometimes, multiple injections are needed to make sure antibodies have been made<br /><p>Thanks to vaccination, millions and millions of lifes has been saved. However, even today, there are still lots of people who don't want to vaccinate their children. In their opinion, it is not safe to inject germs and other product in their baby's veins, which, at first, is comprehensible. But, in fact, it is much more safer than catching an uncurable disease. Moreover, some kids can't be vaccinated because their immunitary system isn't well working or for other reasons, so we must vaccinate every other person so that immunitary deficient children won't get disease from non-vaccinated people.<br />There is a lot of rumor about vaccination like some could cause autisma for example. This false rumor has been spread by a pharmaceutical industrial who wanted to sell his own products by bashing other labs<br /><br />To conclude, vaccination has been a big step in the medical field. It save millions of people everyday and we will continue to develop new vaccines against new germs. However, to make it work, we must vaccinate the most people we can, so that immunitary deficient patient won't catch these diseases, and we will maybe make these germs disappear forever<br /></p>",C1,0.716666666666667,0.935846867960894,9.6150923032491,6.79889696936202,35.154519092358,0.918473136328409,108.641975308642,0.0053382991930478,0.055787628972453,0.16865896053061,5.98906993472936,13.7903431526066,13.2889406779661,67.3283898305085,11.585593220339,-4.03750988098504,169504822.417306,39.5330508474576,38.8635593220339,38.9406570621469,12.3940542023435,12.3950282485876,24.5812076271186,8.74830677966102,7.5222906779661,6.77009270538244,81.0131479461756,-435.494666115819,503.750988098504,8.75,-53.0072478813559,43.378125,7.10175833333333,12.7054166666667,15.9686440677966,7.70421859067797,51.6,10.9322033898305,10.4554237288136,111.125,15.75,48.9611581920904,8.72441299435028,9.20722725988701,8.37354809322034,9.06678983050847,5.9375,1.6766704416761,14.4649794597067,13.9601358718713,13.8685325596421,8.86853255964208,5.83781991525424,6.58235381355932,11.0625,-467.178518135593,-285.47537180791,87.5,22.125,1.66666666666667,365,16,57,37,21,15,11,6,44,22.8125,17.381,9.8649,2.3125,2.7143,1.7619,0.4054,0.7143,1.3125,0.5238,0.2857,0.1622,2.0952,1.1892,11,French,Pharmacie,Oui,4,1,2,15,Oui,1996,M1,22,Anglais,C1,quotidienne,M
cohort_student49,"In 1885, Pasteur discovered the vaccination. On the 6 July 1885, he received in his office a young boy, Joseph Meister, who had just been bitten by a dog, supposedly sick. Pasteur hesitated to inoculate the boy because he didn't have any symptom of rabies, but he decided to do it anyway. He gave the boy 13 shots of vaccine in 10 days, each one stronger than the precedent. He survived. Pasteur decided to inoculate a really vigorous form of the virus and then again he survived. He was vaccinated.<br /><p>I think this discovery changed the world. It opened the door to modern medicine and shaped our current demography. Before vaccination, child mortality was extremely high, up to 30 percents and thanks to that invention we are now down to 0.01 percents. <br /></p>",C1,0.857142857142857,0.962793708144385,6.80336051416609,4.81070235442364,48.3611899953965,0.935453180357804,214.159737969262,0.00563236047107015,0.0538280157390894,0.143797557932089,6.41063555473438,14.761033864949,6.61477272727273,54.1772727272727,5.19818181818182,-2.2265519919414,28281737.9479089,44.6181818181818,47.9590909090909,52.3170166666667,8.72887816526666,8.72939393939394,28.2632121212121,8.71720484848485,7.29142,5.31482167938931,84.6771232061069,-297.300345408369,322.65519919414,4.7,-43.8853409090909,60.1279090909091,5.99375696969697,8.15193939393939,11.0375757575758,4.96800315636364,9.72,10.3409090909091,9.805,60.1,7.6,38.2,6.43317636363637,7.01078545454545,5.66512424242424,5.76261696969697,3.3,1.77624784853701,11.0035773159874,10.7424842629882,10.5498344352707,5.54983443527075,5.11377575757576,5.6971696969697,6.24,-322.888108090909,-242.400947651515,47,13.2,1.57575757575758,133,10,19,16,12,4,4,2,10,13.3,11.0833,8.3125,1.6,1.5833,1.3333,0.25,0.3333,1.2,0.3333,0.1667,0.125,0.8333,0.625,12,French,Pharmacie,Oui,0,0,0,20,Non,1997,M1,21,Anglais,C2,quotidienne,F

Labs have to do like inhalations, skin contact, injections or ingestions on a long period to be sure that the drug is safe.</p><p>Some cosmetic industries do run animal testing but it is not an obligation. For exemple if a company wants to commercialise a cosmetic product in China which is a huge country and so a strategic country they are obligated to run trials on animal to commercialise their brand there.</p><p>But some brands have a special label that say that they do not test on animal, they are cruelty free.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Some animal like naked mole rats or axolots are stategic animal for the futur.

I was absolutely amazed by learning how new technologies could change the way to cure patients, the way to treat many diseases with a lot of innovations.</p><p>One of them that makes me suspicious are the GMOs. There are plants, or parts of plants, which are modified by humans to earn special characteristics for example not to died because of pesticides, to resist to insects of predators, not to suffer from the hot or the sun, etc. It also could be modified animals ou any alive modified system. But we have working on plants exclusively. I can give examples of using :</p><p>- In developing countries, mostly poor countries like in Africa for instance, there are special rizes that are made to become more nutritional for peoples, and to prevent for diseases like diarrhea.</p><p>- There is a kind of OGMs invented to resists to pesticides not to died when farmers use it to destroy unwanted plants.</p><p>GMOs are really controlled by European (EFSA) and French (ANSES) control agencies of respect of environnement. In fact, in France, OGMs are not authorised to be sold, because the government and scientists criticize the impact on health and environment. They explain they don't have enough hindsight, that there are not affirmations like ""OGMs are safe"" or ""OGMs are dangerous"".

cohort_student55,"<p>So I'm going to talk about the discovery of the small pox vaccine. The small pox at the time was very curent, many people died from it, and the ones who didn't were scared for live. Everyone could be contaminated rich or poor, at any age. </p><p>Jenner was an english rural doctor in the 18 century. He noticed that girls who milked cow were not contaminated from this disease (most of them) but seemed to have contract an other disease : the cowpox. The cowpox is a virus, present in the bovine, that's why the milker were contaminated. It gives ressemblance symptoms to the small-pox, afterwards the patient have vesicle with pus on his hand or somewhere else. </p><p>Jenner then thought that the cow-pox was maybe a protection against the small-pox. He tried an experience : he infected an eight years old boy with the vaccine by inoculate pus from a young girl. The boy had a fever, but nothing serious (prouv that he contracted the vaccin). Then the doctor inoculated the variole, and the boy survived, and Jenner discovered a prevention against small-pox. So it's was a huge progress in medicine but at what cost ? </p><p>I was talking about the discovery of immunisation by Jenner. Nowadays Jenner is considered as the father of immunisation. But what people often forget it's that he wasn't sure of his theory when he tested it on the 8 years old boy. He could have killed him. So we could wonder if he should be described as a hero, or in contrary as a paria. If we should endanger a few people live to save the masses or not ?</p><p>Because if we think about it,  in the 50's,  Americans doctor infected prisoners with different disease to observed the evolution of the disease, it was kind of the same thing except, they didn't find anything and they were strongly condemned by the public opinion. </p><p>This exemple is for one, one of the basis of immunisation, but also it raise ethical dilemma, witch we still see today. I think the main reason people praise him he that his experience was a success, but I can't forget that he risk a life of someone, who I suppose couldn't understand the risks he was taking. </p>",C1,0.761627906976744,0.94710103044523,9.98865635678561,7.06304664482522,42.2603401488371,0.93244124642638,108.842617631152,0.0050999592003264,0.0570146821165887,0.153827331358654,6.59718496088676,15.1905797466623,8.20527694235589,57.4347117794486,6.06441102756892,-3.19074677786531,83680930.1291104,50.1526315789474,49.9026315789474,54.0090636842105,8.26525051427157,8.266,31.5142857142857,7.8582343358396,6.77725513784461,5.47065949239854,87.1723288855384,-335.656973500661,419.074677786531,5.66666666666667,-48.7854061403509,63.5720175438597,5.92214636591479,8.88766917293233,11.4486215538847,5.90455937844612,40.1190476190476,9.69736842105263,9.09710526315789,79.0952380952381,7.61904761904762,36.2531328320802,5.69586591478697,6.35172431077694,5.45169022556391,6.00151629072682,3.28571428571429,1.74635922330097,11.0134389069725,10.7515377884546,10.5592894601845,5.55928946018454,5.11431328320802,5.76674436090225,8.01428571428571,-368.548095025063,-227.3618555,56.6666666666667,18.0952380952381,1.47631578947368,389,21,58,51,29,21,14,4,48,18.5238,13.4138,7.6275,2.4286,2,1.7586,0.4118,0.7241,1.381,0.4828,0.1379,0.0784,1.6552,0.9412,12,French,M�decine,Oui,10,2,3,3,Non,1997,L3,20,Anglais,B2,quotidienne,F
cohort_student56,"I would like to talk about the sleep. First of all, the sleep is really important because it concerns all of us. Everyone need to sleep but not as long as the other. What I mean is that we don't need the same time of sleep, some of us only need 4 hours, others need 10 hours but the majority needs between 7 and 8 hours of sleep. That is what is advised by the authorities. Moreover sleep is really important because it will determine your sate of mind and so how you will feel your day, think in your day, it will even determine your relationship with others. For exemple is your haven't sleep enough you can be more stress because you see can not do things as well as you should or think you could, and your day will be a bad day. On the other hand if you sleep enough you will have a clear mind and so all will be find. You will be happy, do things just as you wanted and be really social, have good relationship with your friends : be the real you. <p>However people seems not to care enough about there sleep, they don't see that it can't deteriorate their health. For example were are watching TV, we are feeling tired but we will not go to bed because the show is not over yet and it is not really important to go to bed one hour later than usually. If we usually do that, in a long term, we will have debts of sleep. And our body make us understand. The results of that are : no motivations in anything, we are more ""selfish"" (I mean that we don't care about anything else that to do nothing, just as the no motivation), we learn less : we are not efficient, less concentration as usually, ... In other terms, we are a bad version of ourselves. </p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>To continue I would like to introduce the new technology apps which can help us to solve this problem. There is applications or devices which can help us. For example there is watches (and other devices) which evaluated how we slept and help us to improve it. Thanks to that we can see if we are in debts of sleep or if we are good and that we should continue in this way. Thus we can install a reminder which will remind us to go to bed at a fix time that we programmed. It would help us to have a ""routine"" and sleep faster than usually. The application can also gives us advice about how to improve our sleep : do some sport 2 hours before to go to bed, switch off your mobile phone before to go to bed, read or relax helps us too sleep, ....</p><p><br /></p><p>I don't think that the sleep is really important in our society, people don't seems to understand how important it is.

cohort_student57,"<p>I would like to describe an experience that would certanly takes place in a near futur. This experience consists in doing a ""head greff"". In fact, there is a russian man who suffer from a genetical illness. He is paralized and condamned to be sit in a chair for the rest of his life. He can't speak, eat or doing something by himself. So, when a group of researchers who worked on a relovutionary surgery announced that they were searching patients he purposed him.</p><p> They had already tested it on monkeys and mise and the surgery succeed. They took a mouse's head in one part and the body of an another mouse in another part and connected the two spine cords between them. It worked on animals but the surgery seems a little bit more complex on the human body because they have to disrupt all the blood and nervous system during a few minutes. </p><p>I don't know if the surgery had already beeing realise because she is not authorized on the russian soil so she will takes place on a chinese clinic with chinese and italian surgeons. The russian man who accepts to undergo this experimental surgery is now waiting for a compatible body.<br /></p><p>I think that this experimental surgery has a two-side consequence. </p><p>First, she can be a new alternative for people who suffer from a desease with physical consequences, for people who have all their mind but can't use their body. It can be an escape for them, a way to finally have a fonctionnal body which permits to do whaterver they want to do. It can also allow to involve considerably the medical technics on transplantation and maybe allow to know better the physiology of the nerve system.</p><p>However, this surgery asks ethical questions. Indeed, how recognising himself with a body which is not yours? Are you you again or are you a kind of mix of two people? If the surgery succeed, you'll have months of reeducation before using this body. And if it worked, this sort of experience will certainly open to some disgressions from people with bad intentions.<br /></p>",A2,0.757575757575758,0.94562579290801,9.73123680201904,6.88102353203975,40.7819086071889,0.92979628607363,122.314049586777,0.00620842572062084,0.0650492502545394,0.156590794090893,6.44694058145307,14.8446292782722,8.71792134831461,58.4011235955056,6.78741573033708,-3.1443079643319,80076075.2793616,47.4292134831461,47.5893258426966,51.0998471910112,9.06238747027415,9.06314606741573,33.3050786516854,7.57980134831461,6.56670359550562,5.64053521126761,85.7306678873239,-342.960711303371,414.43079643319,5.95,-48.5194971910112,58.5410337078652,6.18587258426966,9.51604494382023,12.7379775280899,6.17135455191011,39.084,10.0140449438202,9.44544943820225,80.3,10,40.8337078651685,6.50377235955056,7.12192629213483,6.43801685393258,6.88861258426966,4.1,1.72426699937617,12.1617449614717,11.8112499293252,11.6602540378444,6.66025403784439,5.13920449438202,5.78868764044944,8.22,-379.84089852809,-247.374823988764,59.5,17.8,1.53932584269663,361,20,53,39,22,17,12,10,41,18.05,16.4091,9.2564,1.95,2.4091,1.7727,0.4359,0.7727,1.1,0.5455,0.4545,0.2564,1.8636,1.0513,8,French,M�decine,Oui,0,0,0,2,Non,1997,L3,20,Anglais,B1,mensuelle,F

cohort_student61,"<p>I would like to talk about robots in medicine. The first robots have been used last few years to help doctors, specificly surgeons for their operations. They think that robots are more precise than humans, even than the highest surgery specialists.</p><p>Moreover, robots are never tired so they can pratice during hours and hours, perhaps days and days.</p><p>Some surgeons have already tested for minor operations and it was a succes. The doctor was able to control the robots with his own hands to be more precise.</p><p>Biologists tried them too and we saw that robots are able to screen and analyse many more tests than humans in the same time. </p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p>I believe robots in medicine are great and not great at the same time, I explein myself :<p><br /></p><p>   - First, we can look the scientistn and technology side and say that robots are probably better than humans. For example, it's possible for us to analyse hundred or thousand of biologicals tests in a few seconds againts hours, even days, for a doctors. So, We could win a lot of time with them. </p><p>The problem here is that robots can analyse </p><p>only simple cases</p> because when the cases become more and more difficults, we need a real doctor. And sometimes, we need to thonk about humans feelings and robots can't do this.<p>Other exemple, the surgery. As i said in the first paragraph, robots don't need to sleep so it's a big advantage and they can stay at the hospital all the time. The surgeon has to comme back at homme every day. In cas of emergency, robots are already there and the pracionner loose a lot of time to come.</p><p><br /></p><p>  - But if we look on the other side, there is a bad aspect. Some people would like to use robots as GP or nurses for example in the future. They will do our consultations and they'll know our private life and I believe It will be really sad for us. We can learn technology skills to them but never human relationships. I think that a robot could nerver learn feelings or emotions (like happiness or sadness) and these are the base of our job.</p>",B1,0.664772727272727,0.921030591984768,8.81920682889959,6.23612095340161,28.435222249368,0.898308091913918,151.084710743802,0.00948051948051948,0.0810028550569152,0.187530402811392,5.30998119753696,12.2266835495273,7.68773317591499,56.409681227863,5.59693034238489,-3.02852251725941,71542188.2558145,48.6161157024793,48.9039944903581,54.802367768595,8.04788202193388,8.04859504132231,33.4915899252263,7.58227363242818,6.55651948051948,5.3696592738753,87.3388929755327,-322.912875391578,402.852251725941,5.61904761904762,-47.9827851239669,65.7693388429752,5.78517926013381,8.38007870916962,10.7710350255805,5.59971684486423,35.9235714285714,9.87603305785124,9.29363636363636,75.1428571428571,6.66666666666667,33.814639905549,5.06820173160173,5.65683179850453,5.03541562377017,5.54381574183392,2.85714285714286,1.6130876747141,10.5042237277757,10.2853158092137,10.0710678118655,5.07106781186548,4.73845021645022,5.3611341991342,7.57142857142857,-355.302137095632,-226.717581046832,56.1904761904762,17.2857142857143,1.46005509641873,368,21,54,42,28,12,13,11,37,17.5238,13.1429,8.7619,2,1.9286,1.5,0.2857,0.4286,1.3333,0.4643,0.3929,0.2619,1.3214,0.881,8,French,M�decine,Oui,4,1,2,3,Non,1997,L3,20,Anglais,B1,mensuelle,M

cohort_student64,"<p>The scientific discover I am going to right about is PMA (Procreation médicalement assistée in french). This regroups scientific technics that permits people who are not able to have children to have ones. That can help women as much as men who are not fertils. </p><p>First of all, if a in a couple the man is sterile, like if his spermatozoïde are not good enough to do the ovulation, the couple can have access to the sperm of an anonymous person who have gave his sperm before. Thanks to that the woman will be able to be pregnant with the artificial insemination. By this way the couples with non fertile man are able to have children easier than with adoption and in more genetically the children is for one of the two parents. </p><p>Moreover if that is the woman who can't have children, the couple can have access to ovocytes from an other woman, still an anonymous person. After the method is a little bit more complicated because that supposed fécondation out of the body</p><p>This two methods are based on the donation. </p><p>There are other methods used in PMA like FIV (fécondation in vitro in french), in this technic the spermatozoïde and the ovocyte can be those of the couple or not. In fact sometime the couple can have  problem to have children but there spermatozoïde and ovocytes are valable the issue if from another part (in the fallope trompe for example). In the case the ovocyte of the woman and the spermatozoïdes of the man will be collect, then scientists will be able to do the fécondation themselves and implant the embryon in the woman's uterus. </p><p>These are only a few of example of what can be possible with the PMA, there a still other possibilities to make the parents dream true. </p><p>In my opinion PMA is a revolution for all the humanity. Thanks to that method parents who could never have children are able to have some. That makes possible the dream of the parenthood. Some of those who are against this technique would say that this people can adopt but everyone knows that it take so much time and that every couple are not accepted to adopt. </p><p>Nowadays we are talking to give the possibility to woman who live alone to have access to the sperm donation and also to couple of lesbians, that is a huge evolution but all our population is not able to accept that. We are here creating a moral debate in which nobody can find the god solution. There are pros and coms to analysis but finally I hope that one day what have been given to couples who couldn't have children will be given to this lesbian couples in France. </p>",A2,0.661904761904762,0.92283050318021,9.59191127485872,6.78250550699231,30.0924509091575,0.904679554619566,116.553287981859,0.00692640692640693,0.0667913481962252,0.182293515217244,5.56329173552672,12.8099526182008,11.2283739198743,63.5051060487039,8.35428122545169,-4.47855742609922,231253519.64821,50.1171641791045,47.687526652452,53.6526496801706,8.36290937703454,8.36383795309169,25.2941207496353,8.46324622376838,7.37345357423409,5.93968349077823,88.324649302744,-410.38237440018,547.855742609922,7.73684210526316,-55.4736527886881,55.3314858040624,6.51827784760408,11.6739423184828,14.6498036135114,7.81654792050275,70.2076315789474,9.70149253731343,9.10164179104478,106.473684210526,11.7894736842105,43.4475367523286,6.63612324093817,7.28230851756256,7.12585255302435,8.13954422623724,4.63157894736842,1.70509648688768,12.9366865371767,12.5314250302452,12.4032469196325,7.40324691963255,5.86625855683986,6.64825833239816,11.0684210526316,-446.062602100774,-222.73524130064,77.3684210526316,24.6842105263158,1.49466950959488,472,19,64,51,23,27,14,5,51,24.8421,20.5217,9.2549,2.6842,2.7826,2.2174,0.5294,1.1739,1.2105,0.6087,0.2174,0.098,2.2174,1,9,French,M�decine,Oui,2,0,1,4,Oui,1997,L3,21,Anglais,B2,hebdomadaire,F

cohort_student68,"<p>Unit tests frameworks have been created in order to help developpers finding bugs. When you are writing some code, you always have to make sure that you didn't make a mistake. To prevent mistakes and bugs, you can test your program with some specific inputs in order to see if you program responds correctly for a given value.</p><p>A unit test is a function that tests a small portion of your code. Some 
frameworks (like Google Tests, Junit) brings you a set of useful test 
functions. For exemple, the most well known test function is 'assert'. 
For a strongly typed language (such as Java or C++), the framework has 
an assert function for each primitive types. If your function should 
throw an exception, a framework's function can catch it or alert you if 
the exception did not happen.<br /></p><p>Unit tests are written in a file which is integrated with the project : it means that they should not be removed at the end of the developpement, even if the project is terminated. It could be benefit for other developers which may find your code some years later and read your tests in order to see how your software is working.</p><p>Adding a new functionality to jour project which uses some tested function is easier. If a bug happends then you know where it is located.</p><p><br /></p><p>Unit tests frameworks have changed our way of coding. We learnt in a course at the university that we should write some tests before the function, this method is called Tests Driven Development. We can't be sure at 100% that our program is working correctly but we can avoid a good amount of dumb errors by testing the code with some specific values.</p><p>I not always use this method because i don't like writing tests. I find that a bit boring but it forces me to think how to design my function before coding. Thanks to the university and to the TDD, i saw a better code quality in my projects and I became more comfortable with errors detection. <br /></p><p>Unfortunately, unit tests are not magic : it means that if you write a test with a bug then your function may pass it even if the function was wrong.<br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p>",C1,0.668478260869565,0.92276963303931,9.06768030352617,6.41181823225505,29.325483124563,0.901680466466717,146.502835538752,0.00926585887384177,0.0807477693379961,0.184661947807237,5.42336571989218,12.4877610604786,9.07747056320046,59.1651298056462,6.83640232657115,-3.47595911194312,108191512.911787,50.2157681940701,49.3599730458221,52.8579889487871,8.58064959607655,8.58145552560647,29.017408142999,8.18009960278054,7.04606276067527,5.63946648648649,86.9577351351351,-354.782884726613,447.595911194312,6.10526315789474,-50.2371673996311,65.4745495815009,5.85303982125124,8.97782380479501,11.0450276634984,6.04950815258902,40.5792105263158,9.6900269541779,9.08902964959569,86,6.31578947368421,37.5856149808483,5.30775148247978,5.94007025109945,5.0013200312101,5.71205739821251,3.52631578947368,1.70559311616472,10.3075183128099,10.1059716228454,9.88247201611685,4.88247201611685,5.82869229677968,6.53614583628883,8.41578947368421,-387.879171204426,-227.684278059299,61.0526315789474,19.5263157894737,1.4366576819407,377,19,58,47,24,22,14,4,34,19.8421,15.7083,8.0213,2.4737,2.4167,1.9583,0.4681,0.9167,1.2632,0.5833,0.1667,0.0851,1.4167,0.7234,11,French,Informatique et electronique,Oui,0,0,0,2,Non,1997,L3,21,Anglais,B1,quotidienne,M

want to talk about the discovering of the Down syndrome or trisomy

is  known from centuries. But the scientific answer was in 1953.
A french doctor, named Jerome Lejeune, discovered that it was due to
a caryotype with 47 chromosome with 3 chromosome 21.</p>

If
we talk about the different criteria of this injury , we can remark
that there is some evidence on the phenotype of the new born that
show us the trisomy 21. In it’s general aspect the new born has a
hypotonia.First we can see that the eyes of the new born have a
specific inclination ant an epicanthus. If we look at his hand, there
is an brachymesophalangis on the fifth finger, and there is a split

cohort_student71,"<p>Today, I would like to talk about cancers's research. Indeed, during the last decades there was (is) important studies about the cancer. </p><p><br /></p><p>The approach I choose is a genetic one : with a much better understanding of the genome, researchers can identifie genes who can lead to cancer or protect us against the cancer. </p><p><br /></p><p>For that researchers can do several things : </p><p>- ""Knock down"" of the genes of interest</p><p>- ""Knock in"" of the genes of interest</p><p>- track the genes</p><p>- ...</p><p><br /></p><p>Usually, studies began by a short story of the cancer, and the challenges that came with it. During the first experiment, researchers (usually) show us where the genes (or the protein encodes by the gene) are by using fluorescent markers : this alload us and them to check the position of the gene and his ""time of action"". </p><p><br /></p><p>Researchers can also start and show us the very begining of the experiment : they take a sample of the tumor/tissue of interest, isolate the cells and use flux cytometry to detect all of the genes in the tumor. With a lot of samples it's possible to detect wich genes are always present or absent, wich one are here only in a subtype of tumor... </p><p><br /></p><p>After that, researchers can Knock down the genes using a transgenic mice. The transgenic mice is made up by the team : she has modified expression of her genes and she's usually the progenie of two mice who were modified. One of the mice has  gene who is inactive and the other has a marker who is going to attach himself to the kock down gene in the progenie. </p><p><br /></p><p>Ater that, researchers can analyzed how the mouse is reacting : they marked their weight, their size, their attract to food,... They can also look how their interact with each others, how their react to fear, to cold water, to the drowning test,... </p><p><br /></p><p>One thing that matter a lot in oncology is the reaction to drugs : drugs against cancer are very strong and can kill every working or not working mechanism in the body. Scientists are testing the reaction before and after the drug to see how patients would react to the treatment. </p><p><br /></p><p>Thanks to the genotyping of the begining, scientists can also compare the reaction of a certain type of tumor and an other type of tumor against the drug : all of the tumor don't express the same genes, wich is tricky because that mean that all of the patient would not be responders. Researchers have to test wether or not a subtype of tumor is responding to the drug because if not the patient is not going to be able to fight against is cancer. </p><p><br /></p><p>Who is responding and who is not responding alload us to gave drugs only to patients who would respond and try other treatments with the non responders. <br /></p><p>I truly think that research is very important and has to be done because it's the only thing that alload us to create new treatments, help and cure patients. </p><p>If we turn our back to research, we chose not to help patient, we deliberetly ignore things that we could know. </p><p><br /></p><p>About the cancer research specifically, I think that the more we have data on the non responders and the responders, the more we can chose appropriate drugs to cure/help patients. </p><p><br /></p><p>On the other hand, we have to be very carrefull about all the data that we collect : indeed, there are a lot of correlation that we don't know about and a lot a things that we don't no for sure of they are significant. </p><p><br /></p><p>For example, they are some families who have a predisposition to cancer : we can test them and look for the mutation that give the cancer and Watch for the cancer to appear more carefully than the general population. But there are a lot of significant genes discover every weeks so the result is not for sure because theire  are a of mutations that we don't now about, there are also all the mutations who are maybe cancer's help but we don't now about them. </p><p><br /></p><p>Research in general is a very fascinating subject that alload us (in médicine and in general) to help and create a more comfortable environnment for everyone, that alload us to understand everything that's happening among us. <br /></p>",B2,0.575757575757576,0.904800868826367,10.4591557687004,7.39573996953447,26.4552197990587,0.891692379363886,100.091827364555,0.00700009210647509,0.0688913988950625,0.194421510498021,5.35126040489209,12.3217324370338,13.6442597765363,68.2978212290503,10.4945474860335,-5.25317688123313,372933264.561602,50.0122905027933,46.7650837988827,51.0529282122905,9.07524345811955,9.07625698324022,21.5498525139665,8.82811941899441,7.73259372067039,6.4155855944056,87.7752240559441,-463.534311356425,625.317688123313,9,-59.4900790502793,54.1737798882682,6.67235903910615,12.8181474860335,15.9811396648045,8.8191658615419,124.2296,9.71368715083799,9.11505586592179,126.2,12.96,46.7964245810056,7.13895716201117,7.7795887821229,7.69351720670391,9.01802981005587,5.2,1.63931297709924,13.412043294602,12.9747484026893,12.859006035093,7.85900603509299,6.41494279329609,7.27947463687151,12.552,-501.482795526257,-232.298741829609,90,28.64,1.4608938547486,725,21,105,82,33,42,26,18,86,34.5238,21.9697,8.8415,3.9048,3.1818,2.4848,0.5122,1.2727,1.5714,0.7879,0.5455,0.2195,2.6061,1.0488,7,French,M�decine,Oui,13,4,6,10,Non,1997,L3,21,Anglais,B2,quotidienne,F

cohort_student73,"<p>I'm gonna talk about one of my experience as medical worker.</p><p>At the end of my second year of medicine, I worked for the first time in an EPHAD  (sort of center for elder person) as an auxiliary. I discovered the envirnment where medical staff (like nurse)  used to work.  </p><p>I saw how careful and kind could the medical staff be; as much as they could be rash, brutal and disrepectful with some residents. I don't judge them for their behaviour because sometimes people living over there were not easy to manage. Most of the people working at this EPAHD were ""human"", they were really concerned by the mental end physical health of the residents.</p><p>It is very stressful to work right there because we have to work efficiently and to be fast at the same time. We have a dozens tasks to do, and it changes every day (even in the same morning or afternoon sometimes).  Indeed, we have to take care of all the 60 residents at the same time and to do what is asked by the direction. I know it's hard to be always smiling and kind when we are under pressure. However, it doesn't justify all the bad actions some employee made. <br /></p><p>So, after my one month working in an EPHAD and my experience at hospital, I really understood how hard it was to be a nurse, an auxiliary and a helping-nurse (AS in french ?). <br />There are not enough staff, whether for nurses, auxiliary or helping-nurse. They can't be asked to do millions things correctly, to be kind with everybody, to take time to take care of all patients and to do all of this quickly. It's simply IMPOSSIBLE.</p><p>Some doctors are forgetting that when they ask ""little things"" to nurse, it's already too much for them. </p><p>I think that I will never forget how important it is to be careful and respectful with our collegues. If medical staff is not well treated (intern students as well), how can we expect them to be good/to treat correctly their patients ? <br />To be able to take care/to treat in best conditions our patients, we have to be treated with kindness and respect as well. <br /></p>",C2,0.713414634146341,0.933784051444164,9.13616507048346,6.46024427537852,33.4487974023365,0.913843517455608,114.515169541939,0.00538680233428101,0.0538934913248844,0.172905873405162,5.7796864106407,13.3082197713215,8.41730883813307,57.9036742800397,5.99543197616683,-3.46578607836645,107243171.115337,53.3451482479784,52.1739892183288,55.8657194070081,7.75651941960216,7.75730458221024,38.4918016739963,6.60535566747056,5.89417596822244,5.44071553342817,88.3612025604552,-344.142462995062,446.578607836645,5.63157894736842,-50.1983776422187,67.5268406866222,5.74266246276068,8.69157043552277,11.7997446446304,6.23516852994751,41.946052631579,9.32614555256065,8.68876010781671,83.2631578947368,7.78947368421052,37.3160732018726,5.27888355795148,5.98567672010214,5.56037663498368,6.22979324726912,3.47368421052632,1.70648030495553,11.1011313398914,10.8320843591548,10.6433665770771,5.64336657707708,4.85618555823521,5.51619974464463,8.27368421052632,-379.826315409278,-220.859669218329,56.3157894736842,19.5263157894737,1.41239892183288,377,19,55,37,21,14,10,12,35,19.8421,17.9524,10.1892,1.9474,2.619,1.7619,0.3784,0.6667,1.1053,0.4762,0.5714,0.3243,1.6667,0.9459,14,French,M�decine,Oui,8,2,6,15,Oui,1997,L3,21,Anglais,C1,quotidienne,F

cohort_student76,"<p>In 1929, Alexander Fleming discovered the first antibiotic : the Penicilline. It was an unexpected discover. Fleming was working on the staphylocoque. His research was contaminated by a fungi and when he go back he observe in inhibition of the bacteria growing up. Fleming understood than the fungi is capabable of killing the bacteria. He developped the first antibiotic with the extraction of the fungi and he identified the penicillium. He applied this effets to other bacterias. He noticed that the penicilline is active on staphylocoques and positive gram bacteria. The penicilline has been employing as antibiotic since the second world war. <br /></p><p>I believe that is the most important discovery of the 20th century. Thanks to this, we discovered the antibiotics and how to fix bacteria infections. During this period they killed a lot of people and they developp around the country. Now, we cure people who have an infection. The problem of the 21th century is the bacteria resistance. We need to developpe new antibiotics. <br /></p>",B1,0.790123456790123,0.946394630357186,7.11111111111111,5.02831488843767,35.6024971303317,0.914753505350538,205.761316872428,0.00833333333333333,0.0703642784887531,0.167594503007905,5.59166862573568,12.8752928225815,8.01963636363637,56.7636363636364,7.50909090909091,-1.82458375122843,15421281.5509024,39.7318181818182,45.8075757575757,42.5408090909091,11.4075981458545,11.408,26.4706060606061,9.15834242424242,7.5628,5.78127739837398,79.1233993495935,-302.836539992609,282.458375122843,4.33333333333333,-41.7129090909091,38.2627272727273,7.11865757575758,10.6551515151515,14.3393939393939,5.40479050909091,12.085,10.9090909090909,10.43,55.9333333333333,10.9333333333333,43.1212121212121,8.74274545454545,9.30065454545455,8.34370606060606,8.04702424242424,3.53333333333333,1.74608904933815,12.5738666990773,12.1938207224145,12.0553851381374,7.05538513813742,4.67363636363636,5.20454545454546,6.14,-336.259900606061,-290.090293393939,43.3333333333333,11,1.86060606060606,165,15,26,21,19,5,6,1,20,11,8.6842,7.8571,1.4,1.3684,1.1053,0.2381,0.2632,1.2667,0.3158,0.0526,0.0476,1.0526,0.9524,10,French,Pharmacie,Oui,0,0,0,5,Non,1997,M1,20,Anglais,B1,mensuelle,F

the hospital when I assisted to an open-heart surgery.<br /></p><p align=""justify""><a></a>It
was the first time I went to the theatre room and I discovered all
the processus and the technologies used during the operation. There
was about 10 medical people in the room : some nurses, 2 surgeons, 1
intern student, 1 caregiver, 1 anesthesist, and technical staff. So
much people circled the patient who had been sleeped.<br /></p><p align=""justify"">The surgeon opened the rib cage with electric saw,
then the pericardium with an other tool. I believe the staff stopped
the heart with ice and potassium. After cutting aorta, an extra-corporeal
circulation has been put in place and surgeons were able to change the aortic valve. During the process the temperature of the body decreased to 20°.

This observation led him to a conclusion : they were protected thanks to their contact with the cows.

cohort_student82,"<p>For years, there is a debate about vaccination. Indeed, it's a challenge for the labs, GPs and pharmacians to sensibilise the most part of people to vaccinate themselves every year. For example, when winter is coming, for their own good, it's recomanded to vaccinate ourself against the flue especially old people and young people. However, it's more and more difficult to find a vaccin againt every virus of the flue because there are different variants of this virus. The flue virus is changing, evoluting. H stands for hemaglutinine and N stands for neuraminidase, there are two proteins on the virus and there are differents types so there are many ""types"" of flue (H1N1 is the most famous one). The issue of vaccination is that everybody has to be vaccinate for that's works. <br /></p><p>To illustrate we can imagine that a family come to visit his child in a hospital bedroom. In order to not contaminate the patient, you have to wear a mask. If everyone wear it except one person it's not working. It's the same about vaccination. Many virus can be importe from others coutries, we should do more prevention.</p><p>Vaccination is about virus but it's the same about parasites importated from tropical vacations destinations for exemple, or Africa or Asia.</p><p>Vaccination is also a debate because some people think that labs produce too much vaccins and that's why they recomand us to vaccinate. It's about an economic question here.<br /></p><p>To my mind, it's take 20 years for un medication to be commercialized. There are research and development, clinical trials on animals, then on humans. <br /></p><p>I think that healthy profesionals should be more sensibilise people, and do prevention to explain the different risks, the advantges and the inconvenients.</p><p>It's a role to play, everybody doesn't have enough scientific opinion to know they should be vaccinate. So it's our role to sensibilise people.<br /></p>",B1,0.746666666666667,0.941696729924573,9.14476170639053,6.46632301492381,37.3236570820206,0.922739986411017,132.444444444444,0.00662192393736018,0.0656953043670019,0.163684631377045,6.09047283202809,14.0238319523131,9.25576923076923,59.3307692307692,7.99384615384616,-2.73329801560782,52556220.0385304,42.5884615384615,44.4089743589743,44.493241025641,10.8726239860103,10.8733333333333,26.4411282051282,8.86384974358974,7.45465230769231,5.91665344051447,82.0091855948553,-341.07461157985,373.329801560782,5.8,-46.3465,50.5433076923077,6.56494666666667,10.0850256410256,13.8041025641026,6.05816139076923,32.04,10.5769230769231,10.0646153846154,75.8,11.8,38.9974358974359,7.57841615384615,8.12886230769231,7.46050897435897,7.63933435897436,3.65,1.64109406270847,12.9410639471413,12.5355024471828,12.4074438611134,7.40744386111339,5.12224102564103,5.73988205128205,7.77,-376.537829820513,-276.029267435897,58,15.6,1.66025641025641,325,20,55,40,24,13,10,8,35,16.25,13.5417,8.125,2,2.2917,1.6667,0.325,0.5417,1.2,0.4167,0.3333,0.2,1.4583,0.875,9,French,Pharmacie,Oui,1,0,1,2,Oui,1997,M1,21,Anglais,B1,jamais,F
cohort_student83,"As I have no idea of what I should talk about. I think the best thing to do here is explain the last thing interesting I saw on the internet. So, earlier this week, the Blizzcon 2018 took place in California. The Blizzcon is organised by Blizzard, one of the most famous firm in the video games industry. This year they announced a lot of new games that'll be available next year. The one that caught my attention is Warcraft III - Reforged. Let me tell you about Warcraft III first. Warcraft III is a RTS (real-time strategy) that went out in 2002. It was one of the best game at the time due to a stunning and very rich lore, also the gameplay was really immersive for the year. What is very interesting with the Reforged version is that it will be the same game but, with everything upgraded. The developers are making a new interface, new characters models, new campaigns and scenarios and mainly the game will support the 4K which is awesome as we had to play in very low quality. <br /><p>Consequences of this annoucement are multiple. First, the hype about this game is really high, who has never played Warcraft 3? Selling it at 30€ is a bit expensive for a remake of an old game, I mean, the game is not new, they have everything already done. They just need to do it again with today technologies. Also, it's quiet certain that Blizzard will organize e-sport event around W3 Reforged to make money. A game like that can gather a lot of players because it awake nostalgia in everyone older than 20/25 years old.<br /></p>",C1,0.76056338028169,0.944772925427806,9.06315866960424,6.40862095424681,38.9716160244836,0.925886070112466,131.918270184487,0.00619318749375687,0.0627101886394026,0.160186455805235,6.20465193320626,14.2867390486174,6.88153862256646,54.8354615867699,4.74913125392506,-2.87013314229583,60866838.8422624,54.2830960854093,54.3916370106761,57.0383790035587,7.4352059995089,7.43587188612099,31.9719300816412,7.88408124345824,6.75964831484195,5.1858556302521,88.1547613445378,-311.080142287491,387.013314229583,4.64705882352941,-47.1448938664434,68.7273979485033,5.60853307515177,7.77960226083316,11.4516223571279,5.63806801750052,27.3438235294118,9.21708185053381,8.56879003558719,70.3529411764706,8,35.0347498429977,4.8333439815784,5.55676307305841,5.61957749633661,6.01735411346033,3.05882352941176,1.75021240441801,11.2081432601887,10.9304705874509,10.7459666924148,5.74596669241483,4.76012643918777,5.37320577768474,7.11176470588235,-338.584460942014,-211.155067402135,46.4705882352941,16.5294117647059,1.43416370106762,282,17,42,36,21,15,12,2,32,16.5882,13.4286,7.8333,2.1176,2,1.7143,0.4167,0.7143,1.2353,0.5714,0.0952,0.0556,1.5238,0.8889,14,French,Informatique et electronique,Oui,1,0,1,10,Oui,1998,L3,20,Anglais,B1,mensuelle,M

cohort_student86,"A the last few decades more and more deseases became treatable, thus increasing the life expectancy. And because cancer is mainly a desease of old people it became one of the first cause of death in the developped world. In the battle against cancer the nanoparticles are one of the most hopefull lead. Those particles are able to reach the tumor and deliver the medication right inside it. The main advantage is thair ability to be very specific and therofore to damage only the tumor, while leaving almost untouched the suroundings tissues. Even more, they deliver the medication only when around the tumor, which largely reduce the amount of medication in the general circulation and the amount of sides effect. Howewer great in theory those nanoparticles appears to be less efficient then expected in practice. Furthemore the hypothtical sides effects du to the particles themselves are still unexplored and need to be taken in consideration.<br /><p>This lead in research is exiting and promising, but as often in medical and biological research it is dispointing to see that the effective results are far from what was expected... Frome greats ideas, years and sometimes decades are needed to develop an actual effective treatment, which is almost never as promising as it apperead to be in the first place. As for those nanoparticles use to cure cancer, years of research will be necessary before allowing a test on actual patients with no garantee of success. Research is all about patience and be prepared to be dispointed because great break through and discovery are rare and always based on lots of smaller discoveries and disapointment. <br /></p>",B1,0.807142857142857,0.956643037764794,9.55024307843224,6.75304164273932,49.4990406393272,0.94195761138111,106.122448979592,0.00349434737923947,0.0419843706137807,0.14213518827314,7.04888327616334,16.2306535539487,13.3073862238622,67.3840713407134,11.50049200492,-4.12255747615197,180418982.610009,38.1883763837638,37.5186346863469,39.8016623616236,12.1581353062657,12.1591143911439,21.7754335793358,9.18482521525215,7.85228105781058,6.75314481481482,81.4582685185185,-439.705947681427,512.255747615197,9.16666666666667,-53.4891239237392,41.2479720172202,7.22696156211562,13.1163929889299,16.7086100861009,7.96447104784748,40.84375,11.0885608856089,10.6274169741697,112.416666666667,17.3333333333333,50.2586100861009,9.40927281672817,9.88634323493235,8.87318625461255,9.57037318573186,6.25,1.59822090437361,15.021129683784,14.4821835085682,14.4017542509914,9.40175425099138,6.17534717097171,6.94280719557196,11.425,-472.506745116851,-287.156252804428,91.6666666666667,22.5833333333333,1.68634686346863,271,11,37,21,12,11,8,12,36,24.6364,22.5833,12.9048,1.9091,3.0833,1.75,0.5238,0.9167,1.0909,0.6667,1,0.5714,3,1.7143,8,French,M�decine,Oui,0,0,0,2,Non,1997,L3,20,Anglais,B2,hebdomadaire,M
cohort_student87,"<p></p><p><span lang=""en-gb"" xml:lang=""en-gb"">The GMO, genetically
modified organisms, are subject to many controversies. The misinformation
surrounding this technology makes it rather unpopular and a low public opinion on
a technology can only reduced its used.  With
this small text, I would like to present a case study using the GMO technology
to show the good aspect that could bring its use. </span></p>

<p><span lang=""en-gb"" xml:lang=""en-gb"">The Golden Rice
is a genetically modified rice where researchers managed to add a beta-carotene
gene within the rice genome. Why? </span></p>

<p><span lang=""en-gb"" xml:lang=""en-gb"">One of today
major goal is to reach food security on the planet despite the constantly
increasing population. In India, where rice is the staple food, this goal is
far from being reached. Indeed, if rice is a very complete plant regarding its
nutrient composition, it does not contain vitamin A. The vitamin A deficiency can
have several consequences. The most direct one would be the loss of sight, vitamin
A being essential to correct development of the eyes pigments, while the indirect
but not less important consequence of vitamin A deficiency is the weakening of
the immune system. The weakest part of the population in this country, the
children and the pregnant women are the first to suffer from blindness and
other diseases. </span></p>

<p><span lang=""en-gb"" xml:lang=""en-gb"">The golden
rice by bringing beta-carotene, a precursor of vitamin A, to the organism consuming
it, could be a solution. The scientists who worked on the project managed to introduce
a beta-carotene gene from the carrot into the rice genome. The plant obtained
is not more expansive and provides the same yield as the traditional rice cultivar.
Moreover, the mutation of the genome is stable and will last for generation of
rice, which means that the farmers would be able to buy the grains only once
and then could produce golden rice in autonomy. </span></p><br /><p></p><p><span lang=""en-gb"" xml:lang=""en-gb"">In my
opinion, GMO technology is not more dangerous than any other technologies. For
example, internet is a technology. Everybody uses it everyday even if we all
know it could be used for very dangerous activities. GMO are the same. If we
learn to use it properly, they could be an actual solution to reach food
security. </span><span lang=""en-gb"" xml:lang=""en-gb""></span></p><br />",C2,0.740331491712707,0.942164585358683,9.96014155971203,7.04288363845033,39.036265044019,0.926841967342805,118.128262263057,0.00632289748311848,0.0659555885360861,0.160053756268997,6.3467142471244,14.6138496149215,9.80483193277311,60.4802521008403,8.16016806722689,-3.17120351626932,82152441.0196868,42.8525210084034,43.4505602240896,46.2447358543417,10.3927073969669,10.3935014005602,26.4033879551821,8.72368072829132,7.40458941176471,5.95727,83.47027,-359.979715521008,417.120351626932,6.6,-48.6269768907563,49.8500231092437,6.65445745098039,10.74068767507,14.8710924369748,6.7046339994958,42.67875,10.546218487395,10.0308403361345,84.55,13.8,43.0600840336134,7.85753120448179,8.40989661064426,8.01283172268908,8.3514894117647,4.5,1.63039621525724,13.7400552585995,13.2812504613406,13.1734949746879,8.1734949746879,5.75890602240896,6.43932338935574,8.79,-393.669231887955,-258.548789047619,66,17.85,1.64145658263305,357,20,45,32,21,11,9,6,47,17.85,17,11.1562,1.6,2.1429,1.5238,0.3438,0.5238,1.05,0.4286,0.2857,0.1875,2.2381,1.4688,11,French,Sciences de la vie et de l'environnement,Oui,40,10,1,7,Oui,1997,M1,21,Anglais,C1,quotidienne,F

Each year the vaccine changes because the virus changes, we don't met the same strains. <br /></p><p>The virus in the vaccine are not alive so we can not catch the flu, but some side effects can appeared like muscular pain, fever or headaches, but it is really rare. </p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>I think it is important to get vaccinated each year against the flu because even if it is look like benign it can cause complications. Particularly for fragile people like pregnant women, people after 65 ans, people with chronic diseases or obese people. Babies under 6 month can not be vaccinated so it is better that the family is vaccinated to protect the baby and avoid the complications. </p><p>However, there are simple gestures to limit the propagation of the virus like washing his hands regularly, using disposable tissus or coughing and sneezing in his elbow. Moreover, people contaminated should take a mask. But despite these gestures, it is more safe to get vaccinated because we can not know exactly when the epidemic will start; the vaccination campaign has started on the 6 of October this year. Plus, it takes 15 days for the vaccine to be active. </p><p><br /></p>",B1,0.716535433070866,0.931190192700541,8.07494423568664,5.70984782675724,30.5741841682575,0.904145181409801,166.780333560667,0.00887389076365454,0.0754256081649709,0.180851685793779,5.37410215790514,12.3743275170195,10.0624242424242,61.0757575757576,7.93939393939394,-3.61308007885606,121488323.799196,43.6409090909091,43.2070247933884,49.6536305785124,9.45865660696529,9.45950413223141,25.7461570247934,8.68213856749311,7.42822424242424,5.9028897648686,85.5327690179806,-377.201811722286,461.308007885606,7.33333333333333,-50.9686212121212,57.0187258953168,6.3226782369146,10.3163223140496,12.033608815427,6.40198370192837,27.7416666666667,10.4545454545455,9.93,91.6666666666667,8,42.0674931129477,6.24740385674931,6.74514077134986,5.66586239669421,6.38458898071625,4.41666666666667,1.66758241758242,11.2081432601887,10.9304705874509,10.7459666924148,5.74596669241483,5.67437327823691,6.38332644628099,9.25,-404.797329779614,-239.693914876033,73.3333333333333,20.1666666666667,1.52892561983471,243,13,34,26,16,9,5,6,21,18.6923,15.1875,9.3462,2,2.125,1.625,0.3462,0.5625,1.2308,0.3125,0.375,0.2308,1.3125,0.8077,10,French,Pharmacie,Oui,1,0,1,2,Oui,1997,M1,21,Anglais,B1,jamais,F

The discovery is that ulcer is caused by a bacteria which lives in many stomach of people. We are talking of infection because this bacteria causes damages to the stomach. The scientific community did not believe the searcher so he decide to infecte himself from this bacteria. It did causes ulcer and he cured himself by taking antibiotics which eradicated the bacteria and relieved himself from stomach aches. <br /></p><p>This discovery is a great step forward in medecine about understanding a disease which affects many people in industrialized countries.

cohort_student94,"<p>I can speak about aquaponic system. It is a system which used animal population ( for exemple fishes) and plants. Furthermore:  you have to feed fishes, fishes produces waste like nitrogen, ammonium, phosphorus... These waste will serve for growing plants. Plants are using waste of fishes and they are in a substrate with bacteria. Bacteria permit ton convers ammonium which come from fishes waste into nitrate. Plants use preferencially nitrate and not ammonium. Ammonium is toxic for fishes so it is essentially that it is convers into an other hands before to return to the fish population. So plants are growing with waste fishes and substrate and after the water return to fish population.</p><p>I think it could be the urbain solution for the future. Cities are too plenty , there to much people and less space because of the builting of houses; building, shops... It is complicated in cities to keep ""free area"" to cultivate plants to eat. The aquaponic system permit for plants to grow without roots in soil. It grow asssentially thinks to fish and water. So we will not need to keep free area we will can create vertical farms with aquaponis sytem.

But at the beginning, AlphaGo was loosing all its games, and game after game, AlphaGo learned, and now, AlphaGo win against the first world player.<br />To be a perform deep learning program, you need a very large database but if you don't have a database, the program can create its own one. For exemple AplhaGo played against itself to learn new techniques and become more stronger.  <br />So, AlphaGo is one of the most famous application of deep learning, but this way of programming has many applications in every domain.</p><p>The deep learning revolution has many application. The most important one is probably in medical domain. Searchers have train a deep learning program to detect cancers or tumors in IRM pictures, and this program is faster than doctors and more efficient with a lesions localisation of 100% and a diagnostic of 90%. Those  medical programs are not going to fully replace doctors but help them to diagnostic and prevent errors. Deep learning programs are also in autonome cars to make them able to self-driving, or prevent a accident and react before human's reaction.<br />We can imagine a future where deep learning programs will be in every domains and will improve dramatically our life.</p>",B1,0.632258064516129,0.909097958704556,7.87154942324449,5.56602597562124,24.0955171848276,0.878449000073536,207.700312174818,0.0144113950565563,0.102790804962451,0.203719158604012,4.77990919491375,11.0061476580736,10.4423356807512,61.7467136150235,8.71558685446009,-3.38744182807414,100127949.173845,38.3140845070423,38.8950704225352,45.4619626760563,10.6071903789099,10.6080281690141,26.1824788732394,8.68988910798122,7.40513370892019,6.0890131213192,83.3300954534747,-374.66095553621,438.744182807414,7.66666666666667,-49.7828157276995,53.8662582159625,6.46359924882629,10.4496338028169,13.0662910798122,6.44553843230047,32.7693333333333,11.0739436619718,10.611338028169,90.0666666666667,10.4,48.5107981220657,7.75156882629108,8.1895655399061,6.56130845070423,7.10386234741784,5.6,1.61458333333333,12.3406265835799,11.9771789721335,11.8317608663278,6.83176086632785,5.46190516431925,6.14310704225352,8.98,-410.497274159624,-267.952609119718,76.6666666666667,18.9333333333333,1.58098591549296,288,15,34,24,22,5,4,9,32,19.2,13.0909,12,1.6,1.5455,1.0909,0.2083,0.2273,1.4667,0.1818,0.4091,0.375,1.4545,1.3333,12,French,Informatique et electronique,Oui,5,1,1,1,Non,1997,L3,21,Anglais,B1,hebdomadaire,M

cohort_student99,"<p></p><p>So the disrupting technological advance in my speciality( computer science) is I think the new technology that we call the « blockchain » . It is fairly new and the vast majority of people don’t really know about it. Blockchain is the main technology behind most of the cryptocurrency that are built today. </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>What is a crypto currency you may ask ? Well you certainly may have heard about bitcoin, now or before (and you will certainly heard about in the years coming). Bitcoin is the first crypto currency based on the blockchain technology that was created by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008. </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It seems quite incredible, but before bitcoin we didn’t have « virtual money ». We didn’t know how to send money from one person to another. From a point A to B. And that’s what bitcoin does. The great thing is there is no need to go through an intermediate like banks or government. The bitcoin network is truly decentralized which means that at least you take control of all the computers on earth, no government can shut it off. </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Bitcoin first solved a main problem in the computer science field named « Byzantine fault tolerance ». It is basically solving trust issues. How do you trust a system knowing that people will maybe try to lie to you ? </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In the Byzantine problem, we have commanders outside of a city, that they must overtake. The commanders can only communicate oraly or by sending message to each other. But the problem is the messengers can lie. So how do you make a satisfeasible plan, knowing that some may lies ? </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Bitcoin solved this problem by creating the blockchain, a very big register where all the transaction are listed. And with the miners(people who uses computer to power the bitcoin network) all the transactions made on the network are verified. So there can be no fake transaction. </p><br />There will be real consequences in the real world. Well bitcoin is the first of it's kind and has many drawbacks. It's like the myspace of social network or the emule of p2p. Cool but sadly determined to disappear. <p><br /></p><p>Bitcoin was started on 2008. And to verify the big register file of all transactions, there are miners that use their computer hashpower to resolve problems and run the network. This is called the proof of work. The problem is we didn't know it will be so successful and bitcoin consume a LOT of energy/electricity. If the network was a country it would be the 42th country, that consume the most electricity right between czech republic and switzerland. </p><p><br /></p><p>This is a great drawback and people are trying to find alternative. The another drawback is that if someone controls 51% of the network mining power, it is theoricaly possible to corrupt the network and create false transactions. So literally creating bitcoin ""out of nowhere"". </p><p><br /></p><p>If we want to be truly visionary we can imagine a future where fiat money(dollar, euro) will disappear and let the place to crypto currency. It might take 10-20 years maybe, but it is definitively possible. The proof of work, which is one of the main problem will soon be solved by the proof of stake concept which is more efficient and cost less energy. </p><p><br /></p><p>Children(!) in sweden, norway or even israel are already familiarised with cryptocurrency and they no longer ask for money at christmas but for bitcoin or other cryptocurrency. </p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p>",B1,0.655172413793103,0.925420505904073,11.1571841707794,7.8893205861053,33.0170917321017,0.913989595259068,88.4661117717004,0.00541701467605298,0.0598619518762393,0.174032593328231,6.0134659338129,13.8465170164251,7.59327125506073,56.1101214574899,6.10931174089069,-2.5160340319711,40980345.664389,47.0973684210526,49.1026315789474,50.2910031578947,9.28401397072421,9.28463157894737,28.2487179487179,8.62749325236167,7.2588032388664,5.48810881438421,84.4987887792348,-306.388469002472,351.60340319711,4.92307692307692,-45.2912259109312,61.9835425101215,5.92680850202429,8.24473684210527,11.3900134952767,5.29625747368421,51.7,10.0526315789474,9.4878947368421,67.3846153846154,8.1025641025641,37.9487179487179,5.95025371120108,6.55585155195682,5.77644480431849,5.9919338731444,3.41025641025641,1.72354294478528,11.2597670650739,10.9779693511039,10.7954621908666,5.7954621908666,4.9881632928475,5.58538326585695,6.73846153846154,-341.328374089069,-245.062032140351,49.2307692307692,14.6153846153846,1.53684210526316,574,38,85,71,42,27,22,13,74,15.1053,13.6667,8.0845,1.8684,2.0238,1.6905,0.3803,0.6429,1.1053,0.5238,0.3095,0.1831,1.7619,1.0423,15,French,Informatique et electronique,Oui,0,0,0,5,Non,1997,L3,21,Anglais,C1,quotidienne,M

cohort_student102,"<p>The scientic discovery that I want to talk is about the radioactivity. Radioactivity has been discovered in the 19th century by Henri Becquerel by chance with an experience on uranium salts. Radioactivity is the emission of ray by a particle after a fission or a fusion.

After some years, Albert Einstein found the theory of relativity, it's a relation between the weight of a particule in mouvement and the energy. All these discoveries permitted to develop nuclear energy and to build nuclear plants.</p><p>In my view, the discovery of the radioactivy is an important step in the sciences history. It permits to develop some inventions in medicine like the radiography with X rays, the radiotherapy and curitherapy. Furthermore, the nuclear plants, despite the ecological problems, provides a lot of electricity for peaople. However, radioactivity has developped some problems in the world such as the atomic bomb used in 1945 in Japan and the accident in Tchernobyl in 1986 wich killed many people and destroyed the planet. I think, for the while, we can't stop the production of nuclear energy because we didn't find a energy enough efficient to substitute the nuclear energy.</p>",B2,0.851851851851852,0.965754345126789,8.85270412757426,6.2598071204459,59.3775695928543,0.95090214238398,145.747599451303,0.00536517826237452,0.0608703107248436,0.129774328790251,7.56880303752833,17.4278130460208,11.7778759155536,64.3097802671262,10.3580353295993,-3.4538991602548,106129914.87584,37.9718009478673,38.486018957346,39.8693473933649,12.1395893368284,12.1404739336493,17.4470099095218,10.1256433003016,8.4611472641103,6.48150917748918,80.7101082251082,-401.354329203157,445.38991602548,7.81818181818182,-50.0392705730289,30.5948384317105,7.72096204222318,13.7572598018096,18.0992675570875,7.72605796449806,29.2868181818182,11.1137440758294,10.6551184834123,96.1818181818182,20,48.0917707884533,10.4793090047393,11.0147277897458,10.2631960792762,10.554297544162,5.54545454545455,1.68451242829828,15.9031890086143,15.3119697385515,15.2474487139159,10.2474487139159,6.20559241706161,6.92657475226196,10.6636363636364,-439.808187040069,-299.422003412322,78.1818181818182,19.1818181818182,1.85308056872038,214,11,20,16,12,3,2,7,32,19.4545,17.8333,13.375,1.4545,1.6667,1.3333,0.1875,0.25,1.0909,0.1667,0.5833,0.4375,2.6667,2,10,French,M�decine,Oui,8,2,4,2,Non,1998,L3,19,Anglais,B1,hebdomadaire,M
cohort_student103,"<p style=""text-align:center;""><b>Artificial womb</b></p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Researchers recently found out a new way to conceive babies. Indeed, they constructed an artificial womb which is able to ""replace"" a human womb. A human baby could grow up safely in this machine without needing to be in his mother's belly. It is quite incredible to have been able to build that machine as we know all the specific mechanisms that are required to lead a safe pregnancy. In fact, every foetus needs a specific environment to develop and become a sound baby. It means that the artificial womb has to replace the mother in every single way, such as nutriment supplies which enables the foetus to grow as well as the security and the warmth of the mother's womb. It is quite impressive because this artificial womb is made with a see-trough material so that you could litteraly see your baby's evolutio month after month.</p><p>Apart from the craziness related to that kind of discoveries, we can also think that is logical in our century to develop those kind of medical machines. As we all know, not having the capacity of giving birth is a real trauma for many pepople that only imagine themselves as parents. Those technologies would enable people with fertility diseases to get the chance of giving birth to a lively and soud baby!</p><p>I think that it is a great discovery and that medicine is more and more incredible. However the risk is that even sound women with a healthy womb would start to use this kind of machine. </p><p>Indeed, our society put a lot of pressure on young women not to get pregnant while working and having a career. As a result many of them would use an artificial womb but as we know, the human body is an extraordinary structure and maybe the artificial womb won't be as good as a human's one. </p><p>Moreover, we don't have any idea of how bad or good the outcomes of those artificial pregnancy are going to be. We do have to define rules in order to prevent abuses.</p>",B2,0.720930232558139,0.936432586245148,9.45491136062149,6.68563193861318,35.1678370230521,0.918359764057276,123.039480800433,0.00652794777641779,0.0651109203667941,0.168627022242197,5.96675569340256,13.7389627131661,10.2644075144509,61.5267341040462,7.85115606936417,-3.89077315744893,151698630.4149,46.1829479768786,44.9979768786127,51.6944156069364,8.89947334603699,8.90034682080925,26.564299132948,8.4512387283237,7.29333323699422,5.86229992753623,86.8367257246377,-385.080170765896,489.077315744893,7.4375,-52.4173200867052,52.8509429190752,6.58068106936416,11.2599349710983,14.5459537572254,7.26890497427746,46.94,10.1589595375723,9.60485549132948,95.875,12.75,41.5671965317919,6.97116242774566,7.54673540462428,7.37259024566474,8.09522427745665,4.3125,1.72185863874346,13.3283921629395,12.896657642016,12.778803607804,7.77880360780397,5.47967124277457,6.19968569364162,10.125,-421.22271566474,-238.616432543353,74.375,21.625,1.5606936416185,352,16,56,32,18,15,11,5,51,22,19.5556,11,2,3.1111,1.7778,0.4688,0.8333,1.125,0.6111,0.2778,0.1562,2.8333,1.5938,9,French,M�decine,Oui,20,5,2,1,Oui,1997,L3,21,Anglais,B2,jamais,F

This test is easy to realise whith the necessary equipement.</p><p>    At the first step, we must to do a metals mixture. The colour is done by the using metals. For example if we use niquel, the glass is going to be yellow or if we use copper, is going to be blue. We mix this metal with another whit metal who is abble to react with the colour metal at high temperatures. So this glass is comestible beacuse this metals are meltings whith humidity<br /></p><p>    Secondly, we put the metals mixture in a oven at 900°C so that te metals can be react. When is it molten, we put out the mixture, we put the liquid on a brass spuport, beacause the fusion temperature of the brass is very high. And we crush the liquid with brass piece. We must to make that very quicly because if the liquid mixture is not crush whith brass quicly, the liquid cristalise. We can not have glass if the liquid cristalise.</p><p>   To finish, we must to look if the glass is well done and not cristalise. So that, we use a rayon X diffraction. If the glass is well done, when we pass an echantillon in the RX, we must observe pics on the diagram. In effect, the glass is well stucture so the RX can traverse and create pic. If the glass is not well done and we create cristal, the RX diagram do not present pic. The cristal is not well structure so RX can not pass in the cristal and do not provoc pics. <br /></p><p>    So, we can create comestible and colour glass whith only two mtals and a very powerfull oven.<br /></p><p>not time<br /></p>",A2,0.533333333333333,0.87454511802864,6.53197264742181,4.61880215351701,17.3456084359672,0.827593344468264,194.666666666667,0.0128859060402685,0.0834665601703261,0.240107226307068,3.92434872134095,9.03614686546992,5.8730806391676,52.9121144555927,3.44511334076552,-2.86724671762826,60683211.9595239,53.8777591973244,53.983110367893,61.7869481605351,6.13407905622073,6.13471571906355,29.9798049052397,8.20987599405425,6.99986436269045,4.88818993288591,90.4159006711409,-286.246774558084,386.724671762826,4.72222222222222,-47.2328429951691,71.7044881085099,5.45031400966184,7.38465440356745,9.85514678558157,5.25927813147529,27.3202777777778,9.26421404682274,8.62063545150502,67,5.33333333333333,29.9890375325158,4.02147476774433,4.70258086213304,4.42834442586399,4.92145291713118,2.22222222222222,1.71737323358271,9.72561119911124,9.57831244699387,9.32455532033676,4.32455532033676,5.21944611668525,5.85608305462653,6.96666666666667,-314.904418900037,-181.726556655518,47.2222222222222,16.6111111111111,1.39799331103679,299,19,50,37,19,18,11,6,16,15.7368,15.7368,8.0811,1.9474,2.6316,1.9474,0.4865,0.9474,1,0.5789,0.3158,0.1622,0.8421,0.4324,6,French,Sciences et proprietes de la matiere,Oui,0,0,0,2,Non,1998,L2,20,Anglais,B1,jamais,F

cohort_student106,"<p>I'm going to talk here about the NGS : Next Generation Sequencing. It's a kind of new technologie that permits to get the sequence of the entire genoma in a short periode of time, and with fewer costs than earlier technologies.</p><p>To obtain the DNA sequence, researchers first need to extract the DNA from a complete random cell of the human body, thanks to strongs fluids that break the cells membrane. After precipitation, they harvest a double complete filament of DNA. The second step is the Denaturation to obtain a simple filament, after that they do what we call PCR is amplificate the sequence, then they put all the fragments they harvested into a solution with dNTPs (nucleotids that don't have an OH at the end of their molecule so that they create a blocage when they are inserted into the complementary DNA sequence) and normal nucleotids. </p><p>The new solutions composed of previously harvested DNA, dNTPs and normal nucleotid's bases, should now appariate itself complementary to get a new double filament of DNA. </p><p>The new filament obtained is then composed of an ancient part (from the human cell) and a new one which came from the simple nucleotids that appariate together. </p><p>When the dNTP is included into the new sequence, it stops the replication and the filament is complete. Thanks to the previous PCR they obtain those filaments in large quantity, with differents sizes and endings due to the differents lasts dNTPs that have been incorporated during the replication.</p><p>Those finals dNTPS are combined to a fluorochrome, specific from each kind of nucleotid (A,T,C or G).</p><p>So that in the end, we obtain a large amount of sequence with a colored ending that we superpose to each other, to get the entire sequence revealed by the fluorochrome.</p><p>This technic permits to reveal mutations in a single one nucleotid base, to diagnost a pathology.<br /></p><p>This new technic is a relly considerable advance for the genomic field. An anction who used to take years and thousands of dollars, can now be done few hours for 1800$. It is also a lot more precise, because I remind you that we can see mutation for a single nucleotid and visualazing the entire genoma of a person base after base.

cohort_student108,"I heard recently a prodigious innovation in medecine ; some engineers create an informatic program who permits to doctors, when they see a patient, to check information about the medical case and the program gives to them the disease of the patient ! Develop by two young Californians engineers, Alfred Luke and Jeremy Germanik, the program is a list of questions who check the probabilites of a disease. For example, if a doctor have a patient with a dyspnea, the doctor can check the case of the dyspnea and the computer displays the probabilities of a cardiological problem and a pulmonary problem ! This invention permits to all people in medecine to hope a future with less errors of diagnosis, and a semiological learning simplify by this help. If some people was scared by this intrusion of informatical domain in medecine, Alfred and Luke are cleared : the program doesn't replace humans ! It's just an helper program, who absolutely need humans to being good.<p>I think it's a huge progress for the medicine : this program permits to us to have less pressure with a patient, permits also to us to be alleviate during the semiological learning ; medecine is a huge knowledge, and I think if we permits to doctors to have a less-pressure learning, it can be benefit for their practise. This innovation allows also medicine to open window on the future : if we include informatical program in our practise, we can share lot of information between us, increase our mutual experience who prepare us to more different cases of diseases. So, I think everyone is winner with this type of progress : patients, who are being more successful treat, or doctors, who can do more correcty their job !<br /></p>",B2,0.641891891891892,0.911283460082108,7.80895189700447,5.52176284033142,24.4628760026434,0.880103832684822,150.657414170928,0.00836550836550837,0.0673752597591956,0.202183747980387,4.80286908244035,11.0590147528291,16.9782807017544,74.8035087719298,14.0245614035088,-5.86715040638685,519209957.452327,38.4973684210526,35.9166666666667,42.3974221052632,11.4468867534695,11.448,13.8166666666667,9.9164649122807,8.5992701754386,7.3235269170579,84.1541086071987,-535.424730070175,686.715040638685,12.7777777777778,-62.7048771929825,33.099649122807,7.8760298245614,16.5094736842105,19.4035087719298,10.1776104912281,58.825,11.0526315789474,10.5878947368421,151.777777777778,21.3333333333333,62.1929824561404,10.6430350877193,11.1304912280702,9.90841578947369,11.3391403508772,9.66666666666667,1.64343360234776,16.3221223982225,15.706749253055,15.6491106406735,10.6491106406735,7.45417543859649,8.4120701754386,15.9,-572.318848070175,-273.409694877193,127.777777777778,31.6666666666667,1.67368421052632,288,9,40,32,17,13,11,4,37,32,16.9412,9,3.5556,2.3529,1.8824,0.4062,0.7647,1.8889,0.6471,0.2353,0.125,2.1765,1.1562,11,French,Medecine,Oui,1,0.25,1,15,Non,1999,L2,19,Anglais,B2,jamais,M

It was the first contact with this world, I discovered how a ward is organized, the role of different people who work in. It was weird at the beginning, because I had never seen patients before, some of them were really bad and I felt bad for them, I was like ""How do they support to spend this time in a bed, whithout move or eat even drink?"". Some people were totally dependant of the medical team, I knew that before, but in fact, it's really impressive to see it. <br /></p><p>When I was in the abdominal surgery ward, I saw lots of people with colostomy+, and I think this kind of stuff really difficult to accept it, live with in daily life, mostly when you are young, because it can be an problem for self confidence, find a job, find a person who live with and create a family. I talk about colostomy because I saw it, but I think lots of pathology can cause similary problems.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>I knew that being hosptilased can be extremly difficult for people  and their family, but I discovered that is over more diffficult when people are alone and nobody come see them, because they don't have good relations with their relatives or because their relatives are too far (for exemple if the patient is a stranger on vacation).  Psychologic side is very important to go with the deases, and to be cure. <br /></p><p>It permised me to discover the organisation of a ward, and the fact is that, in the medical team, practionners and nurses doesn't always know each other, certain nurses doesn't know the name of the interns, it's abnormal when you know how long they have working together. On the contrary, nurses and nursing auxiliaries really work in pairs, and that's really good for the good caring of the patient.<br /></p>",B2,0.743243243243243,0.940620511654153,9.04194430179465,6.39362013091006,36.5490134026517,0.920996735913845,119.612856099343,0.00523993381136238,0.0535758949437634,0.165410155875184,6.01364822533682,13.8469367581707,15.3570552147239,71.7472392638037,11.7381595092025,-6.01340889462119,558944376.148709,51.7708588957055,47.7187116564417,51.8123392638037,8.86716179236073,8.8682208588957,27.2268588957055,7.62680355828221,6.94620294478528,6.66691292307692,88.5909907692308,-515.813848184049,701.340889462119,9.8,-63.4876809815951,48.9220736196319,7.04672355828221,14.5344294478528,18.438773006135,10.0995715195092,65.982,9.50920245398773,8.8901226993865,141.8,17.6,51.6184049079755,8.44127214723926,9.16152858895705,9.09504110429448,10.6691182822086,6.2,1.71458923512748,15.1122576806783,14.5678133308446,14.4891252930761,9.48912529307606,6.4397963190184,7.36136687116564,14.43,-544.195952552147,-226.489317852761,98,32.6,1.47546012269939,332,10,50,43,16,16,10,7,31,33.2,20.75,7.7209,4.3,3.125,2.6875,0.3721,1,1.6,0.625,0.4375,0.1628,1.9375,0.7209,8,French,M�decine,Oui,0,0,0,0,Non,1998,L3,20,Anglais,B1,jamais,M
cohort_student110,"<p>In the end of 2015 in Poitiers, a scientist discovered on mouses that the environnement is influencing cocain addiction. Indeed, mouses were eather 4 in huge cages with toys, wheels to practise sport and  great food ou eather 10 in smalls cages with nothing else than basic food and water. These mouses had learned that they receive a automatic cocain dose when they go on a special button. So we realised that mouses in the bigger box are going less often on this button and also that it decreases by 80%  the risk of setback after stopping drug taking. <br /></p><p>Besides prooving that lifestyle and life conditions are influencing drug addiction, this study demonstrated that a protein is produced in the brain which is related to a healthy and improved environnement and  that it is this protein which is fighting the addiction. They very recently identified this protein and now  they try to synthetise it with the purpose to create a pill against addiction setback.<br /></p><p><br /></p><p>As a student I was selected to be part of this scientific experiment as a ""beginning reseacher"".

It demonstrates that politicians can act and not only doctors, or caretakers.</p><p>But my opinion about the ""magic pill"" against addiction is a little bit more complicated. Creating an helping pill fighting the need of drug, helping to stay clean is a good idea. But it's not a miracle solution : addicts will still need an huge motivation to stay clean and we still need to help them with a better environnement.

Aspirin synthesis</b>  
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>  The aspirin is a
medicine and its synthesis is important for the pharmaceutic
industry.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>  The mechanism of
this synthesis is quite simple but it require heat and light.</p>
<p>The first step is to
create a phenol with as reactive a benzene. The phenol is a benzene
who has an alcohol function on one of its carbon. This reaction is
hard so we need to synthesis the cumene first and then we had the
phenol. The step two is an aromatic electrophil substitution between
the phenol and a dibrom. Then we use magnesium, carbon dioxide and
water and the product of these multiple addition is a benzene who had
an alcohol function and a carboxylic acid function on two of its
carbon.  This reaction take place in an acid space. 
</p>
<p>With these steps we
have synthesized the salicylic acid.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p align=""left"">  The
last step of this synthesis is the reaction between the salicylic
acid and an ester (the acetic anhydride). For this reaction, we put
both of the reactive in a balloon and we heat the balloon at the
temperature of 55 °C. When we heated the solution, there is a gaze
formation and we used a reflux heater for transform the vapor in
liquid. Then we put the balloon on the ice and we filter the product.</p>
<p>The last manoeuvre
is purification and for that we put with the product ethanol and
water. After we heat again and we filter the melange. The final
product is a white powder who is called aspirin.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>  The aspirin is
used in our everyday life’s. You can take it when you had a
headache or a stomachache or when you are in physical pain and you
need to feel a little better.</p>
<p>This medicine is an
inhibitor molecule and its replace the nor-adrenaline in the synapse.
Like that you don’t feel the pain linked to your sickness. You are

cohort_student114,"<p></p><p>Being in a earth sciences domain, at the beginning of the year my class and I went to a little city called Montbrun-les-Bains un the south of France. After a few classes of cartographic basics, it was time for us to do it in real life, to see what it is like to be on the field.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The aim of this trip was to recognize a couple of series of rock, and identify which ones belongs to which period of the earth time. And then, being able to report everything we saw on a map, and create a geological map of a place we've never been before.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>For 10 days, we had to wake up every morning a 7 to be ready at 8 to walk through the fauna and flora, climbing mountains, against the wind or the sun or the rain, and walk around 5 to 10 kilometers per day, until 6pm. The field was around 12m^2 and rocks we studied about were sedimentary.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>All of us, geosciences students, were separate into little groups of 2 people. My partner and I were watching out and paying attention to all the rocks around us. When there is a « in place » serie, we had to take a « pendage » which means the angle of where the serie is directed compared the geographical north pole. By taking all those « pendages », we noticed that, from the north of the field to the average center, the series were making a syncline. Here’s our first element of our map ! An syncline, with all the younger rocks in the center and, symmetrically, going to the oldest. </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>We tried to understand the south of the field but failed, it was too complicated for us, debutants in cartographics. After finishing our map, we learnt that the south were in discordance, which means news deposits were placed into the olders rocks eroded. </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>After all of that, we went back to our homes, tired of walking and climbing and thinking about what happened in the south.</p><p><br /></p><p>cool</p>",C2,0.801324503311258,0.955854706450101,9.84684035113103,6.96276758554608,49.3592130003667,0.942031147563622,106.574273058199,0.00406181015452539,0.0489179363414133,0.142336370292929,7.08816827446267,16.3211106054111,9.36671568627451,59.8578431372549,6.46078431372549,-4.07112947558728,173759708.083964,54.5058823529412,52.1676470588235,57.9278147058824,7.19149705932941,7.19235294117647,33.8305882352941,7.17570784313726,6.38460392156863,5.50663746312684,89.9220920353982,-376.424062165695,507.112947558728,6.33333333333333,-53.3714460784314,64.6418627450981,5.9707137254902,9.87411764705882,12.7137254901961,6.99595140392157,44.06,9.19117647058824,8.54029411764706,93.6666666666667,8.26666666666667,36.4901960784314,5.22198431372549,5.93250392156863,5.90515882352941,6.82914901960784,3.13333333333333,1.66307471264368,11.3416902125943,11.0533932779918,10.8740078740118,5.87400787401181,5.3793137254902,6.10911764705882,9.58,-413.453658333333,-217.443621911765,63.3333333333333,22.6666666666667,1.40882352941176,342,16,49,31,18,11,8,10,38,21.375,19,11.0323,1.9375,2.7222,1.7222,0.3548,0.6111,1.125,0.4444,0.5556,0.3226,2.1111,1.2258,11,French,Sciences et proprietes de la matiere,Oui,6,1,5,0,Non,1998,L2,21,Anglais,B2,hebdomadaire,F

cohort_student116,"<p>The engram has been discovered recently in neurology by searchers. It is a concept that tries to modelize a connection between neurones that is created when the brain discovers new things of the world through the eyes, the ears, the proprioception receptors etc.</p><p>The theory of the engram applies that when the brain has to encode new informations from the envirronment it creates connections between neuronal cells by putting in place synapses. </p><p>These synapses exchange informations and electrical potentials by sending chemical molecules. </p><p>Once these molecules have been sent they fix themselves on specifical receptors on the other cell, and that opens a canal into the cell's membrane. These synapses lead neurones to connect and to communicate.</p><p>The association of a specifical number of neurones creates a particular signal that is associated to the perception of one thing in the outside by the brain. </p><p>By example, if a person sees a black cat for the first time, his eyes see it, send a message to the brain that connect its neurones and creates an engram relative to the black cat. </p><p>It has also been proved that these engrams, once identified in the brain, could be controled by laser with a new technic : the optogenetic. </p><p>The laser perturbates the engram signal by stimulating or inhibating the electrical activity, and through this perturbation in a mice brain, the comportment  is also modified. </p><p>For example, if the exeperimentator decides to stimulate the sexual engram by laser, the mice tested that is isolated with another mice will have sudently a sexual comportment. Meanwhile, if the experimentator stimulates the aggressivity engram then the mice will attack the other one. </p><p><br /></p><p>This discovery could be very important in medicine to understand some humor comportments in psychiatric domain. Actually, it has been proved that some engrams that were created at the same time by the brain were then associated even if the two elements have nothing in common. </p><p>For example, if a patient sees a black cat in the street, he creates a cat-associed engram, but if he is then shot by a car, then the accident engram will be instantly associed to the black cat in its brain : the patient will then be scared of being shot if he sees a black cat again. </p><p>We can by the way transfer this idea to violent comportments at the adult time against children.</p><p>Actually, most of sick parents that violently abuse of their children were theirselves abused in their childhood. We can think that their engram of love and family is associed to the engram of violence and so when they have their own baby their engrams active them each others and that creates mental disorders and explains in a way their comportment. </p><p><br /></p><p>This discovery in the neurology domain is a great thing that permits once again to understand better the complicated organ that is the brain. </p><p>The understanding of the engrams and the possibility to control them allow new ideas of therapy in case of mental disorder. </p><p>But it is important to highlight the fact that this discovery is really new and that controlling the brain is not easy to do and can have many side effects that could be terrible.</p><p>Actually, we have to understand that sometimes human people can not go through anything and that all the diseases are not curable.  The idea of becoming more and more powerfull on our own body can lead to serious problems and all the experiences have to be realized in normal conditions always respecting patients in an ethical way. </p><p>If we respect these points, I think that it is amazing to be each day more alert about the brain fonctionment and that it will lead to new therapies that will make some serious diseases less hard, less painfull, and that will make some patient's lifes better.</p><p>Actually, brain diseases are terrible, sometimes coming suddently without any previous symptom and ruin people's life by making them uncapable of walking, talking, sometimes respirating...</p><p>They are diseases that scare many people but that can be sometimes cured and we have to encourage that. </p>",B1,0.652567975830816,0.926433771240464,11.8724337344732,8.39507840283389,34.2525101023216,0.917319311603389,80.7769187940964,0.00507186670328664,0.0587202030802007,0.170865270500223,6.20110358815425,14.2785686821959,14.9174486803519,70.6700293255132,12.4386862170088,-5.0244803162312,326398583.238085,43.8300586510264,41.4634897360704,42.3420618768329,11.4620556775003,11.4631085043988,21.6357442815249,8.90235926099707,7.75518477419355,6.94952808810573,83.5710871189427,-479.2336035261,602.44803162312,9.88,-58.1863099706745,41.4537178885631,7.32490921994135,14.2544785923754,18.3020293255132,9.15800222207625,125.8976,10.4325513196481,9.9058064516129,131.52,20.16,53.2330791788856,9.39734503225806,9.98673940175953,9.5566042228739,10.6221281173021,7.08,1.63774733637747,15.954183578675,15.3600026401984,15.2963409191515,10.2963409191515,6.49683014662757,7.34618381231672,13.32,-514.768981946041,-266.159212785924,98.8,27.28,1.62756598240469,685,25,93,68,31,36,18,10,78,27.4,22.0968,10.0735,2.72,3,2.1935,0.5294,1.1613,1.24,0.5806,0.3226,0.1471,2.5161,1.1471,11,French,M�decine,Oui,0,0,0,3,Non,1998,L3,19,Anglais,B2,hebdomadaire,F
cohort_student117,"<p>The scientific discovery I want to talk about is vaccination. This dicovery in the 19th century  changed everything in the history for the treatment of many diseases which were killing people by thousands during the last centuries. </p><p>At the end of the 19th century, Louis Pasteur took care of a little boy who has been bite by a dog with the rage. There were no hopes for this child at the time. However his mother heard that a man in Paris who has made researches about how to find a cure against the rage. </p><p>With all the scientific corpse against him he decided to try his experiment on the boy. </p><p>Actually, Pasteur discovered that when you inject a  sample of a virus or other things like that in animals (he worked on animals at the beginning), that animal could better resist to this virus when you were in contact with it latter. And this animals could actually survive.  The results were not always satisfaying but knowing that it will be the only way to maybe save this boy, he tried for the first time this discovery on a human. And it works. </p><p>The principle of the vaccination is about injecting a firts time the pathogen in the organisme (a very little quantity) that for the immune system recognize it and kill it. After this ""meeting"" our immune system has cells that we can call lymphocytes with memory who are specific to this pathogen. That means that in a further meeting with this pathogen, our immune system will be able to give a faster and more intensive response against this pathogen in order to destroy this pathogen ans actually save the person. </p><p><br /></p><p>To my opinion, the discovery of vaccination was a major step in the medical history to fight against some infectious diseases. After that discovery and the success of Pasteur with the little boy, many diseases which were killing thousands of people before could be eliminate in some countries ans some of them eradicate worldwild (as the variole).</p><p>Some people around the world critizise vaccination because  of the side effects that some vaccins could have. I don't think so. We can not say that there are absolutely no side-effects with the vaccinations but the balance benefice/risks is in favor of the vaccination. Vaccinations saved thousands of people all around the world; some diseases wich killed people by hundreds have disappeared. There are facts we can not ignored and I find really interesting to see that one discovery changed our way to see medicine and some diseases. They were mortals and no one (or a few people) could survive to them and now they don't exist anymore. </p><p>Nevertheless, vaccination works in a collective way, not in an individual one. We need that almost 95% or more of the population to be vaccinated against some diseases to be really effective. </p><p>With people against this, the ""vaccinal cover"" is sometimes not really effective for some illnesses in the country. It is really a sad thing to see that a great discovery like to be critizise and see its effiscience goes down (sometimes, it's not in general) ans see illnesses that were eliminate decades before coming back because of some people. </p>",B2,0.657258064516129,0.923880662165057,10.3505103505155,7.31891605759108,31.4565490049103,0.909326023263235,94.3028095733611,0.00541987723651561,0.0574048049572745,0.178297174975433,5.78076598782936,13.3107055896629,11.152319109462,63.2204823747681,8.99765491651206,-3.89491349689559,152208154.761712,45.7948979591837,44.6696660482375,47.5160276437848,10.0443683614924,10.0452690166976,28.6783309833024,8.10409492393321,7.03789028571429,6.1365731598513,84.931588401487,-394.048660608036,489.491349689559,7.48,-52.3561551020408,52.3226575139147,6.60758488311688,11.3174723562152,14.8577662337662,7.33451770950649,74.7146,10.2040816326531,9.65448979591837,99.8,13.44,44.751094619666,7.65250361410018,8.25466472727273,7.61044233766234,8.30969963636364,5,1.67980691874497,13.6007368921005,13.1510124187239,13.0399203184089,8.03992031840891,5.35199005565863,6.06485981447124,10.14,-434.895204023748,-256.336135157699,74.8,21.56,1.56771799628942,542,25,77,56,31,23,18,7,75,21.68,17.4839,9.6786,2.24,2.4839,1.8065,0.4107,0.7419,1.24,0.5806,0.2258,0.125,2.4194,1.3393,12,French,M�decine,Oui,4,1,2,7,Oui,1998,L3,20,Anglais,B1,hebdomadaire,F

cohort_student122,"<p>Over the past few years, cellphones have taken more and more space in our lives. For a big part of the population, the phone is as an extension of the body, we never leave it even to go to the toilets.</p><p>That's why developers got the idea to create applications to follow our health. </p><p>Thus, a diabetic person can check his glycemia by writing the results of his glycemia tests in his phone, and if the app says the results are bad, he can alert a doctor or emergency. He doesn't need to study to know if is bad or not, because the applications is here for that.  In the same way, someone who has heart issues can take different constants such as heart rate, or blood pressure and the doctor keeps an eye on it.</p><p>In a more common way, you can now have applications to be sure you are moving enough during the day, for example an application that counts the number of steps you take during the day.</p><p><br /></p><p>On one hand, I think these applications are a good innovation because they give more autonomy to people. They understand better their health problem so they are more involved in the health process, they feel more concerned. Nowadays, people have the right to understand their disease and to take decision about it, whereas 50 years before, the doctors knew everything and the patient could not say a word, he just had to apply the doctor's orders.</p><p>Moreover, it is a good way to watch over the patient, it is more safe. Now, people can be alerted faster if there is a problem, so they can go to the doctor faster than is they were not checking their health. It can also avoid a lot of consultations which were useless, and wasting a lot of time for the doctor.</p><p>Besides, it can also encourage people to take care of themselves. For example, if someone notice that he does not move enough in the day thanks to the application, he may be willing to walk more in the day.</p><p><br /></p><p>On the other hand, some people refuse to enter some personal data in their mobile, because it scares them that the data will be sent and used by people they don't want to. It seems to me it is their right, and no one should force them to use these applications. </p><p>Nevertheless the doctor should inform them of the benefits and the risks, thus the patient can take his decision on his own and well informed.</p>",C1,0.695876288659794,0.931170625769208,9.69243514133946,6.85358661465193,33.2387408064906,0.91383097280685,116.909342119248,0.00657016185032851,0.0654486577747576,0.173451363646502,5.84319550605291,13.4544548676872,10.2653013626834,61.6145178197065,7.39486373165619,-4.25291386029927,198069559.2753,55.5617924528302,52.8707547169811,55.6789551886792,7.80769356248113,7.80858490566037,33.8551572327044,7.11377064989518,6.36002620545073,5.71961749408983,89.0608361702128,-392.091685257817,525.291386029927,6.38888888888889,-54.2605799266247,65.6034696016772,5.93962788259958,9.9608176100629,12.6297693920335,7.12699918155136,56.4466666666667,9.06839622641509,8.4052358490566,99.6111111111111,7.55555555555556,38.6498951781971,5.4439605870021,6.19254916142558,5.74892389937107,6.76373291404612,3.55555555555556,1.66256295467264,10.9805187677557,10.7213187218697,10.5277265270908,5.52772652709081,5.21110901467505,5.94523899371069,9.8,-422.880080938155,-211.57551879717,63.8888888888889,23.5555555555556,1.38679245283019,428,18,65,51,23,22,14,7,36,23.7778,18.6087,8.3922,2.8333,2.8261,2.2174,0.4314,0.9565,1.2778,0.6087,0.3043,0.1373,1.5652,0.7059,8,French,M�decine,Oui,1.5,0,1,10,Oui,1998,L3,20,Anglais,B1,hebdomadaire,F

Twitch is the biggest site of streaming, you can follow someone so you are notificated when he/she start a stream. You can subscribe to his/her channel for 5$ and you can always talk in the chat of the stream, when there is lot of poeple it's hard for the streamer to read all the messages. The streamer restrain the chat for the subscribers then. You also have special emote who are exclusive at the streamer. You can donate to support the streamer, some of them have an application who your message is expose on the screen. The streamer and all the viewers can see this message.</p><p>I love Twitch ! When I'm on my comptuer I always have a window open with Twitch to see who is streaming. Video games are my passion so I like to watch people playing game for fun, because they are pro or because a game is new. It's like watching sport but this is for video games. I can stay many hours on a stream like anyone can stay in front of tv to watch Olympic games. I think Twitch is better than tv because you can choose who you want to watch and you can watch anyone, not only the biggest streamer. To conclude Twitch is in my top 3 of my favorite website.</p>",B1,0.616666666666667,0.899022979975532,6.75524487589705,4.77667946032248,20.5906378059466,0.85457590529627,250,0.0168067226890756,0.107175027345396,0.220376408143167,4.2686127486197,9.82884408273606,6.64333907056798,54.4363166953528,4.14802065404475,-3.1049207212924,77086183.4217643,59.4656626506024,58.4194779116466,60.5240791164659,6.48011022577188,6.48080321285141,34.1776563396443,7.43569954102123,6.46096351118761,5.0367529953917,90.0887271889401,-308.568978310535,410.49207212924,4.28571428571429,-48.3558012048193,77.0017771084337,5.1926759609868,6.93759323006311,9.52392426850258,5.37825939862306,23.3110714285714,8.6144578313253,7.90590361445783,72.4285714285714,4.28571428571429,32.2435456110155,3.80351038439472,4.61974589787722,4.05871833046472,4.68389776247849,2.57142857142857,1.73835480673935,9.04235418022936,8.96546171059736,8.66946709513841,3.66946709513841,4.88577022375215,5.52268932874355,7.05,-339.40191340218,-196.066807068273,42.8571428571429,17.7857142857143,1.32128514056225,250,15,46,36,18,17,10,1,25,16.6667,13.8889,6.9444,2.4,2.5556,2,0.4722,0.9444,1.2,0.5556,0.0556,0.0278,1.3889,0.6944,12,French,Informatique et electronique,Oui,1,0,1,3,Non,1997,L3,21,Anglais,B1,jamais,M

Few days after, he saw this box in the been and his eyes was attracted by something. A mushroom was grown in the box. Moreover, he noticed that there were no bacteria around this mushroom anymore.

They separate us in few groups then we can see easily. There are around two or three teachers who explain us the organ function.  We wear gloves and coat. There is a strange smell in the room but i got used to it.</p><p> It is an important subject this year. This experience can be disturbing the first time because it is unusual to see cadavers.

It causes skin lesions such as buttons, or ulcer. Sick people had bad injuries and were desfigured. There were a lot of variola epidemia during spring. <br /></p><p>During a stay in Istanbul, a notable women called Lady de Montaigu, discovered that some children received a little moisture containing piece of sick people of variola. She was surprise because she had variola and had a lot of scars because of the desease. She noticed that this children wouldn't get variola. She brought this invention in Europe. We call it variolation.</p><p>Few years later, an english man, Edward Jenner, observe that some people did'nt get variola : the cowherd. They were in touch with the cow, and Jenner concluded that the cow was the solution : the virus of the cow was called the vaccine, and he could prevent cowherd from the variola. He tried to transfered the substance from the cow to the human. He invented vaccination in 1796.</p><p>This discovery was a medicine revolution : we can prevent a desease and avoid it.<br /></p><p>The vaccination discovery was a revolution in medicine, for the better.<br /></p><p>The medicine exists for cure and treat deseases.

I will most take attention on video games but it is something we can also find in other aspects of entertainment. </span></span></p><p><span><span>In fact, people remember more informations and historical event when they play than they don't. Let's take an example with Assassin's Creed Origins, a video game which take place in Egypt. This game modelise Egypt as it was in Ptolemaic Kingdom (30 years before Christ).</span><span>  </span></span></p><p><span><span>The player take possession of a medjai, a protector of pharaons and the last of its kind. And throught his tinking, we can learn about the mentality of egyptian at this period. For exemple, it was very important to give a decent embalming of people who dead or the importance of keeping all part of the body in place else dead people can't go to egyptian's paradise. We can move freely in all Egypt and in Siwa, a Egypt's region abandonned nowadays. When you saw this region now, you can recognize the place. We also have informations about Cleopatra and her exil before she became a great queen. <br /></span></span></p><p><span><span>In Assassin's Creed series, the second one is interresting too. You can know well about the Borgia's familly because you have to be confront with them. We can meet Leonardo Da Vinci wich work on some engine that historian discover architecture's plans. In the game, Leonardo create these machine but for some reason we ignored, they never will be use. Historian doesn't understand why and the game try to give an answer with connecting all elements of the game. <br /></span></span></p><br /><p></p><p><span><span>A study shows that people who learn Egypt history in class, find this annoying and remember less informations. However student that just play game of this type, can remember more informations but not always. The best combination is when the teacher keep an eye on student and supervise when they playing the game. Student remember significatively more informations by this way.</span></span></p><p><span><span>But these kind of games have limits because the developper add some interactions that make the game funny and not just a historical synthesis.

cohort_student139,"<pre>The new invention that I will present you, is  one of my ideas. Nowadays the expension of radar has increased with the decision to instaure embarqued radar in banalised car, we all now application like Waze, Coyott or Facebook group that prevent people from radar. But with this new type of radar we can't alert people from a radar because the radar drive whatever they want, in consequence I want to develop an original system to prevent them. This system might be composed with a camera in the front of your car. This camera will detect registration plate  who correspond to a banalised car. The  main problem of this system is that we need to save all the registration plates from banalised car in databases. May be people can saved registration plates in an application? Or hire people who done it for us? </pre><pre>Consequences:  it can be very useful for drivers who forgot limitation speed, but also for drivers who never respect limitation speed ... So it can increase death on the road.

It was really complicated to use it and it was really expansive. In fact, they have to use a sort of big computer which consume a lot of electricity. Furthermore, they need a big room to place it. So, it was only reserved for a minority. But, few decade after, American State saw a opportunity to earn money by sharing the access of the Internet. So, the State spend 13 billions dollars to improve this discover. But, some politicians wasn't for it. In fact, they said that some countries will used it against America.

cohort_student145,"<p></p><p dir=""ltr"">Hi, I’m going to describe a video-game : Sid Merier’s Civilization V. This is maybe not the most revolutionary one or the most technical developed but it is probably my favorite.</p><br /><p dir=""ltr"">First let's talk about the Sid Merier’s Civilization game serie. The very first opus of this “saga” have been design (and probably programmed) by Sid Merier a american video game designer in the early 90s. Then he created his own company Firaxis Games and continue to develop Civilization and others games. Today the last “episode” is the 6th one.</p><br /><p dir=""ltr"">Now we will describe how the game actually work. To begin, you have to know than it’s a strategic turn per turn game. That means than it is a bit like a chess game, but with many many more options. When you start a new game, you have to choose the game parameters, like the leader you are going to incarne, the type of map or the difficulty of the AIs. Each leader is a historical leader who had made his or her name unforgettable, for example you can be : Elizabeth the first, Napoleon, Nobunaga Oda, Shaka Zulu, Pacal, etc etc… They all have their unique abilities, military unit and batiment. After having set the parameters you can really enter the game, at the beginning you only have a warrior unit and a steller unit. With you steller you have to create your first city witch is going to be your capital. With a city you can start technologie recherche, cultural expansion, build units or batiments. Then you can reach the victory by five differents ways, military by capturing all the capitals of the others players/AIs, technologie by being the first to send humans to Alpha Centauri, cultural by being so attractive than all the others countries citizens adopt your way of life, diplomatic by being elected world leader at the ONU, points but it is boring and can be desactivated.</p><br /><p dir=""ltr"">To make it more consistent : in this game you have to lead your people and your country throw the ages to make them survive and prosper, and become the most important nation in the world.</p><p><br /></p><p> The game I just talk about probably didn’t had any consequences at the international stage. But to me and other players, this game and more globally the Civilization serie had a very significant impact on our perception on history, strategy, culture, geopolitic and video game medium. Those games are also really useful, because it’s teaching you things at the some time than you are playing, that is due to the game design made to match historical references. For example the leader of Carthage is Didon and her special unit is the war elephant you can also walk throw mountains as when Hannibal crossed the Alps to invade Rome. But it is also due to the Civilopedia, accessible at any moment in the game witch is learning you everything you need to know about any leader/nation/wonder/unit/batiment/ etc etc..</p><p dir=""ltr"">This game made me like history and geography, you really feel concern about your people, and the gameplay is (to me) really addictive, so this is why I think it is one of the best game ever made.</p><br />",B2,0.661971830985915,0.926972179737619,11.1557475870222,7.88830476798888,33.5942977790182,0.915502322794915,102.906169410831,0.00679341064052157,0.070508637803555,0.172531030487463,6.06231801140605,13.9590030820529,12.3395405025479,65.6785274995607,9.50314531716746,-4.70657716279358,268351546.11146,45.0905904059041,42.9060885608856,50.9628789667897,9.09991731158376,9.10088560885609,22.7043437005799,8.82045311895976,7.66098267439817,6.21179032655576,87.2808300677757,-434.873600998067,570.657716279358,9.09523809523809,-56.6781519065191,45.6217281672817,7.06661231769461,13.3078176067475,16.6706729924442,8.50573180376032,90.64,10.2859778597786,9.74457564575646,114.333333333333,16.3809523809524,44.2597083113688,7.67138559128448,8.21719880513091,8.50375340010543,9.51595786329292,4.76190476190476,1.68251981643721,14.6898101857974,14.1710629324351,14.084094137869,9.08409413786904,6.39929555438412,7.22316130732736,12.3571428571429,-463.958025310139,-227.288214188192,90.952380952381,25.8095238095238,1.59594095940959,539,22,76,52,32,21,15,16,50,24.5,16.8438,10.3654,2.3636,2.375,1.625,0.4038,0.6562,1.4545,0.4688,0.5,0.3077,1.5625,0.9615,9,French,Informatique et electronique,Oui,0,0,0,3,Oui,1998,L3,20,Anglais,B1,hebdomadaire,M
cohort_student146,"<p>I will speak about the anathomopathology, also called anapath. </p><p>It a medical speciality where scientist have to describe macroscopic and microscopic lesions and how cells interact together. </p><p>Anapath is used in diagnosis to reveal diseases, but also to evalue the pronostic of a tumor or in DNA therapy. </p><p>Anathomopathologist work also in research, for example in epidemiology, to make statistic or to develop new therapy more resistant. </p><p>This speciality work on cell or tissue prelevment made on body. Doctors have to fixed them in formol, to keep the organisation, then to include in parrafin, to cut thanks to a microtome in a microscopic band, to observe it under a microscope. </p><p></p><p>
On
one hand, this speciality is very important in medecine, because it
helps the clinician to cut of tumor. In fact it will indicate to the
surgeon if he ""kills"" all the tumor. It's now better
because we don't have to make the operation, then verify with a scann
or MRI if the surgeon worked well, and if it's not a good work, call
again the patient to operate another time. </p>
<p>
On
the other hand, anapath can also reserch specific proteins to
see if a treatment will work on a patient. In other words anapath
brings a pronostic. Now a patient can recieve a treatment if we know
that it will work on him.

cohort_student150,"<p>I will talk you about the discovery of anesthesia.</p><p>During a very long time, doctors or surgeons have to make their work really fast. But patient feel the pain and some died of that terrible pain even if they do it quickly. We know that people used alcohol in the past and in every civilizations to sedate patients. Later they discovered opiates and used it to reduce the pain. The cocaïne was the first effective local anesthetic, but doctors thought it was safe for patients and a lot of people became addict to it.</p><p>The ether appeared in the 19th century in France, when a lot of people thought that surgery can't exist without pain. After that some men found the chloroform and the curare to inhibit the muscle contraction. That plant was finding in Amazonia and used such as an anesthetic in the 20th century.</p><p>Now hospitals use some mixed of different chimical elements which proved their effectiveness in this domain, and there are a lot of doctors specialized in anesthesia. They studied every anesthetic to be sure that is safe in any circonstances for every patients.</p><p>In my opinion it is a really good discovery because it saves a lot of lives now. I was a little bit suprised that it made so much time. Now everyone can have a surgery and be sure they will never feel the pain. That was a big progress for medecine and for patients. I can't imagine the pain that patients felt when it didn't exist. </p><p>I know actually there are a lot of discussions about the risks for children. I don't know what to think about that.

cohort_student154,"<p>I am going to talk about test tube baby. Nature gives us the possibility to reproduce ourselves, but we found a way to introduce science in the reproduction syste for those who have diseases. Science can offer the possibility for sterile people to have children, but how is it possible? I will take the example of the test tube baby.</p><p>For the test tube baby, we collect spermatozoons from the male body, and ovums from the female body. We put the ovum on a flat surface and the spermatozooms around, and let the processus happens by itself. The spermatozooms will meet naturally the ovum and only one will penetrate inside it. The fecondation will start. Then, you transplant the embryo in the female uterus ; the pregnancy may start. </p><p>It takes 9 months as every woman, and a baby is born at the end, with no aftereffect. The first test tube baby was born 40 years ago, Louise Brown. She is still alive and feels extremely good, as every human in good health. </p><p>But to give birth in general, we have many solutions, some are ethically correct, others are not. For instance, we can introduce spermatozooms directly in the uterus of the female without taking ovums from her. The test tube baby is for women who have problems with their fallopian tubes. </p><p>But the question of giving an opportunity for sterile people to have baby in a such easy way creates debates within the population. </p><p>Some people think it is a good thing to help these people. They consider sterile people as sick people who need to be cured. </p><p>But others do not have the same advice. For them, things that we can do do not mean that we have to do them. And it goes against nature to give birth so easily, against the process of reproduction which is the basis of nature. And it causes a problem about the child that is about to born : during the experiment, is he a human already, or not? How should we consider him? </p><p>We are now able to freeze embryo and can use them after a long amount a time. But is it really ethic? Same question : is the embryo a human or not? And if one of the parents die, how do we have to consider it? Is it still the other parent's possession? </p><p>Giving birth with science is a wonderful thing that may help thousands of couples who suffer from sterility, but it causes numbers of ethic problems, and I think we should never consider this as a acquired discovery ;it is new and we should be careful about it.</p>",B1,0.669902912621359,0.924806344790969,9.61491559722432,6.79877201933362,30.7721072201748,0.906819604447962,105.57074182298,0.00573052332465072,0.0575386597923852,0.180269137770983,5.62477448861316,12.9515218889339,6.44132053291536,53.9337774294671,4.50987460815047,-2.60414724411832,45438153.29779,48.3318181818182,49.8409090909091,56.5370313636364,7.57257725823818,7.57318181818182,35.1787617554859,7.43939263322884,6.40272586206897,5.13554364150499,87.5891497918467,-291.66360832496,360.414724411832,4.96551724137931,-45.8413090909091,65.8809090909091,5.73012742946709,7.83951410658307,10.4326018808777,5.15579882131661,39.1620689655172,9.90909090909091,9.33,65.3448275862069,6.62068965517241,31.0815047021944,4.87437304075235,5.45736363636364,5.00830846394984,5.33024764890282,2.41379310344828,1.70491803278689,10.478748267446,10.2620635828737,10.0466426341764,5.04664263417644,4.60077115987461,5.18694670846395,6.7551724137931,-328.355309090909,-223.954205795455,49.6551724137931,15.1724137931034,1.48409090909091,441,29,70,54,39,15,14,6,48,15.2069,11.3077,8.1667,1.8621,1.7949,1.3846,0.2778,0.3846,1.3448,0.359,0.1538,0.1111,1.2308,0.8889,10,French,Medecine,Oui,6,2,5,8,Oui,1998,L2,20,Anglais,B2,hebdomadaire,M

</p><p>I would like to talk of the new law about the 11 obligatory
vaccinations.</p><p>
</p><p><a></a>Last year, during my
seconde year of medicine, I worked on this subject with friends for
an exam and I learnt a lot of informations. Before the law applied on
the first of january 2018, the number of obligatory vaccinations were
3, others were just recommended. We fount studies about that we call
""vacination cover"" and saw that if a vacination is not
obligatory, people think that is not for a ""dangerous""
disease and don't want to receive the vaccin. With the other students
we searched about what is happening in the other countries. In Sweden
for exemple, people trust a lot in their doctor and don't put in
reflexion what the doctor say. So, eerybody want to be vaccinaned for
all vaccin, even thoses which are not obligatory. In France, we know
that people are a bit suspicious about their doctor and there is a
lack of information about vacination. So the law was the only
solution, even if it's complicate in our society to oblige people to
do something. 
</p><p>
<br /></p><p>For me, it's a good thing, some people are angry about the government because they don't like the ""obligation"" and say that they are free of their bodys, etc. But we need to take this mesure like a good thing for us, it's for our health. I don't have returns of the application of this law because it's too early I think but I'm sure that in the few years become, It will be better for everyboy.<br /></p>",B1,0.763636363636364,0.942630636453336,8.00908574966298,5.66327884469123,35.5833245996839,0.917211194124917,158.677685950413,0.00683903252710592,0.0629524160797615,0.167639647441052,5.76411945105503,13.2723755222363,10.9550069396253,62.9441360166551,8.21124219292159,-4.31385637174743,206677781.534211,51.6530534351145,49.286641221374,53.0843450381679,8.51862712216183,8.51954198473282,31.9738514920194,7.40937036780014,6.58237432338654,5.92571553465691,87.8394446534308,-406.439598673594,531.385637174743,7.18181818181818,-54.5755957668286,54.7908431644692,6.52725378209577,11.5342054129077,14.2600971547536,7.57288055461485,37.0854545454545,9.52290076335878,8.90519083969466,103.545454545455,11.2727272727273,39.8487161693269,6.38014809160305,7.06061512838307,6.92880333102013,7.879826648161,3.81818181818182,1.68032056990205,12.7193392140039,12.3290980222345,12.1948602243566,7.19486022435657,5.35626717557252,6.10118043025676,10.8,-441.543304677307,-234.693050801527,71.8181818181818,23.8181818181818,1.51145038167939,271,12,38,32,14,15,8,4,30,22.5833,19.3571,8.4688,2.6667,2.7143,2.2857,0.4688,1.0714,1.1667,0.5714,0.2857,0.125,2.1429,0.9375,11,French,M�decine,Oui,6,1,4,2,Oui,1998,L3,20,Anglais,B1,jamais,F
cohort_student156,"<p>The research that led to DNA discovery were extremely long and tedious. It took almost 30 years and involved a lot of people. First, the research began with Mr. Avery, a doctor who found on a bacteria that DNA was the component of chromosomes. He didn't know the structure of our genetical material but it was a really helpful start that was continued by a biochemist, Mr. Chargaff who found out the nucleotides that are contained in DNA. Those nitrogen based nucleotides are adenine, guanine, cytosine and thymine. Chargaff thought that they were linked like a pearl necklace, he didn't know it's structure. Then a woman, Rosalind Franklin with other scientists like Crick and Watson, through X-rays found that DNA was actually a double DNA strand. </p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>I think it really help us because nowadays we can help analysing and understanding diseases.

cohort_student163,"<p>First, I am going to introduce you the history of penicillin. <br /></p><p>This molecule is an antibiotic, discovered in 1929 by Sir Alexander Flemming. Actually, this discovery was made by accident. Sir Flemming was cultivating bacteria for research, and some fungi contaminates the culture. It was Sir Flemming assistant who left the culture boxes open when they went onto vacations, which let the fungus grow with bacteria.<br /></p><p>The fungus, named Penicillium sp,  produced a molecule which has the capacity to inhibit the growth of some kinds of bacteria. The scientist had the ideas to use this molecule to treat human infectious diseases during World War II. <br /></p><p>Now, I am going to talk about the consequences of this discovery.<br /></p><p>The penicillin was then used as an antibiotic (because it was the first of this group of drug) to treat human various infectious diseases during World War II, and even today. This drug was used a little bit too much in my opinion. It was seen as the miracle drug, and used far all kind of diseases, even when it was not caused by bacteria.</p><p>It happened that nowadays, we have to create new and more powerful antibiotics to cure these infectious diseases, because new resistant bacteria emerges as a result of massive and unappropriate use of the old antibiotics. These resistant bacteria are known as ""super bugs"", and are very difficult to cure with antibiotics we can have in pharmacies, such as amoxicillin.</p><p>To conclude, we have now to pay attention to use the right antibiotic to treat the right bacteria, to avoid the emergence of new and stronger super bugs.<br /></p>",B2,0.661971830985915,0.916758137332796,7.88830476798888,5.57787379351111,25.8558407443113,0.886617077165941,146.796270581234,0.00769153930676256,0.0635714494547903,0.196662098006871,4.93970114530369,11.3740822210219,10.4314551248008,61.7384492830589,8.63515666489644,-3.43883526021193,104752878.816895,45.9514869888476,45.6485130111524,46.0681587360595,10.4410902336848,10.4419330855019,22.4893547530536,9.28543935209772,7.84731566648964,6.07050852878465,83.668586140725,-375.676250841881,443.883526021193,6.64285714285714,-49.973314126394,44.864842007435,6.95423908656399,11.7749468932554,16.1615507169411,7.25492064779607,35.2953571428571,10.185873605948,9.63446096654275,90.7857142857143,16.2857142857143,44.8648433351036,8.05915273499734,8.68678337758895,8.82439726500266,9.22473807753585,4.92857142857143,1.6353591160221,14.6561544806555,14.1394780791464,14.0518259641951,9.05182596419511,5.84935608072225,6.55341874668083,9.70714285714286,-410.287777833245,-258.960595873606,66.4285714285714,19.2142857142857,1.68401486988848,269,14,39,25,15,10,6,6,33,19.2143,17.9333,10.76,1.7857,2.6,1.6667,0.4,0.6667,1.0714,0.4,0.4,0.24,2.2,1.32,15,French,Pharmacie,Oui,3,1,2,20,Oui,1997,M1,21,Anglais,C1,quotidienne,F

cohort_student166,"<p>Today I'm going to talk about a laser surgery to correct myopia.</p><p>For many years, glasses and contact lenses were the only options if you had myopia. But now you can have a laser surgery and you won't be myopic anymore. You have to be at least eighteen, and your vision must be stable since at least two years. The operation is 15-minutes long for each eye, and only needs a local anaesthesia. With the help of a laser, the surgeon will cut a part of the cornea and then modify the curvature of the eyeball to improve your vision. After the operation, the vision can be a little blurry, that's why it is important to rest and follow the post-operation care closely. After only a few weeks, people who underwent the operation claims that their vision has clearly improved and that they don't need glasses anymore. <br /></p><p>I think that this laser surgery can improve people's lives.</p><p>Glasses are fine, but they can be a little bit bothering if it's rainy outside for example, and it is worth saying that some people don't like the aesthetic of glasses. Contact lenses can be a good alternative, but at the end of the day, the eyes can be really dry because of them. Moreover, some people will never be able to wear contact lenses in their life. That's why the laser surgery is important, because it gives people an other opportunity to correct their myopia, and this surgery improves your vision for life. It is not only a correction of an optic problem, it is a long-term solution. In addition to that, the surgery is short and mostly well-tolerated.<br /></p>",B2,0.688888888888889,0.924025604656583,8.004165582162,5.65979976088672,28.0401543028482,0.895520658480465,168.449931412894,0.00950801547816473,0.0780532188269416,0.188846874042948,5.14864095973309,11.85518392306,8.51986951364176,58.0642941874259,6.31397390272836,-3.31707207635275,94012120.5902523,45.1016014234876,45.0820284697509,53.8261,8.3153832956,8.31615658362989,31.803537366548,7.76862706998814,6.72658922894425,5.52766761904762,87.1936704761905,-343.360130467251,431.707207635275,6.6,-49.4956820877817,59.8669300118624,6.1362259311981,9.56297508896797,12.1908422301305,6.19604529527877,31.0023333333333,10.2846975088968,9.74316725978648,81.8666666666667,8.8,37.2386714116251,6.15038059311981,6.68667976275208,5.93397971530249,6.50506443653618,3.46666666666667,1.61494252873563,11.6024720560353,11.2938531634939,11.124038404636,6.12403840463596,4.99761945432977,5.6533537366548,8.5,-375.572355520759,-227.220832811388,66,18.7333333333333,1.51245551601423,289,15,42,33,21,11,8,5,21,19.2667,13.7619,8.7576,2.2,2,1.5714,0.3333,0.5238,1.4,0.381,0.2381,0.1515,1,0.6364,10,French,Pharmacie,Oui,1.5,0,0,15,Oui,1996,M1,22,Anglais,C1,hebdomadaire,F

cohort_student174,"<p></p><p>since few  (2years)I have been studying in plant breeding what fascinates me the most is the introduction of biotechnologies to give the plant new traits of resistance to diseases .With QTLs, it becomes possible for each individual to associate a value to a chromosome segment based on the genetic value of the QTL. Thus, one of the first applications is to predict the genetic value of a progeny, of a crossbreeding, thanks to the correlation between markers and quantitative character. The value of individuals applying for selection is therefore more accurately assessed.Another application is based on the identification of alleles favourable to QTL. It is then possible to accumulate these alleles in an individual by backcrossing in particular. This is called genotype construction.</p><p>A better knowledge of the modes of action of QTLs, i.e. the identification of stages of the infectious cycle on which they act, make it possible to optimize the strategies of combination and deployment of resistance locus to increase resistance levels resistance in plants and   to preserve the effectiveness of resistance by limiting adaptation pathogenic populations</p><p>Moreover thanks to this practise we can improve the quality of fruits at differents steps on flavor ,taste, and texture </p><p><br /></p><p>Concerning inconvenients it's difficult to have acces at the practise considering the cost of developpement who is important , but also there are overestimated effects(stability qtl).But for me it's a progress for the agriculture today because many fruits don't have the quality consumers expect.<br /></p>",B1,0.828125,0.961131493509029,9.36916485072175,6.625,54.2138136986905,0.946812553543901,118.408203125,0.00406003937007874,0.0490597395870489,0.135814150177297,7.33564551948721,16.8909480206598,17.1770400359874,74.9950517318938,15.2781826360774,-5.0898821359771,339235231.456804,38.8455465587045,36.9487854251012,32.3981396761134,14.1867301361862,14.1878542510121,10.8325641025641,10.6872586144849,9.06462977957715,7.7050756097561,78.892243902439,-523.628142573099,608.98821359771,11,-58.4150058479532,24.1643139901035,8.25859356725146,16.7068556005398,21.8279802069276,10.0534508197931,50.7816666666667,11.0121457489879,10.5433603238866,145,29.7777777777778,61.0476833108412,12.0966260908682,12.6731879442195,12.1510541160594,13.0394833108412,9.22222222222222,1.64950038431975,18.7160478517551,17.9690476252051,17.9443411809733,12.9443411809733,7.39921097615834,8.29490148448043,15.0666666666667,-564.428815420603,-327.752568218623,110,27.4444444444444,1.82995951417004,250,9,28,18,10,6,3,4,38,27.7778,25,13.8889,2,2.8,1.8,0.3333,0.6,1.1111,0.3,0.4,0.2222,3.8,2.1111,12,French,Sciences de la vie et de l'environnement,Oui,2,3,3,0,Non,1994,M1,24,Anglais,A2,jamais,F

Thanks to NGS, whereas we don't know what kind of mistakes there are in DNA, we can find exactly where they are.</p><p>First, scientists have to amplify DNA many many times. Then, they prepare librairies that is to say they have to cut DNA in different fragments. Then, they incorpore a code to fragments which allowed them to conduct the  experience for several patients. After that, they put DNA's fragments on flow cell. Each fragment is amplify many times thanks to a polymerisation enzym. Each fragment, which have a very high number of copies, is called a cluster. On each cluster, one fluorescent nucleotid (one color coresponds to one nucleotid) is incoporated every cycle. One color coresponds to a specific nucleotid incoporated in a  localized cluster.Thanks to this processs, you obtain a colored map.

cohort_student182,"<p></p><p></p><p>Let me whrite about
an experiment which was realized years ago. This experiment is about
the duality of the light which can act like a particle or a wave.
Until the discovery of this duality, people did not understand the
way light behaved. This experiment and the results the scientist
observed made possible the comprehension of some phenomenon related
to the light. 
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>First, we can talk
about the experiment which was made. This experiment some scientist
realized was Young’s. It was a really simple experiment because
they just made light going through two little gap and they observed
that the light did not behave as expected. Also, the two gap were
separated by a larger space (if they had not, the experiment would
not had worked). Besides, the two gap needed to be really tiny to not
let pass to much light or it would not had been possible to observed
anything. Scientist discovering that light could comport as waves or
particles was a really big step ahead to understand a lot of
observations made in the past which were impossible to even believe
because light has in the same time properties of waves and particles.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>After they made this
experiment, they observed a spectrum designed on the screen behind
which one was created by interferences. Some of these interferences
were called constructive and others, on the opposite, destructive
because the first one permitted to see the light on the screen when
the second kind of interferences let a black screen. These
interferences are observed because of the difference of vibration
between two « wave » of light when it goes through the
different gap because after, there are two part of light which can
interfere.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In conclusion, we
can say that there are no direct applications of this discovery but
it permitted to understand better the way that light was acting and
also a lot of phenomenon which are linked to the way that light
behave.</p><br /><p></p><p>In my opinion, there
are no direct applications of the discovery of the wave-particle
duality but, it permitted understand how light was acting and, this
can be used to define and explain a lot of things which can be useful
and used in every day life. Maybe it is not the most useful discovery
human made but, it is one of the most important anyway. Besides, that
is possible that in the future, this discovery will be used to make
something useful for every day life.</p><p></p><p>We made this
experiment in class, Young’s, to see the same phenomenon scientist
observed and then, we talked about the different kind of
interferences. I do not think it was very useful to make this
experiment except to see what scientist did in the past and why, in
the first place, they did not understand what they observed because
they did not know about this duality. But, because there
are no direct applications of this discovery, we did not see anything
about what we could do with this so, I think that is why I do not
believe that, for now, it is really useful.<br /></p><br /><br />",B1,0.491666666666667,0.870461398970723,7.61686724754125,5.38593848213413,18.3745325547684,0.840021234409135,160.069444444444,0.0118898186889819,0.0867892169181057,0.233287704752649,4.20911743353006,9.69185105710767,13.0712427745665,67.0829479768786,10.4019653179191,-4.74747840283754,275396007.176851,52.7696531791907,49.7802504816956,47.9265662813102,9.93187913265587,9.93287090558767,31.6339990366089,7.32710747591522,6.57191248554913,6.44077166023166,85.9015233976834,-440.686067705202,574.747840283754,7.6,-56.7255505780347,51.7211835260116,6.74182888246628,12.4919643545279,16.3915606936416,8.46104435063584,86.08125,9.39306358381503,8.76236994219653,118.6,15.6,45.7958574181118,7.58326196531792,8.3322061849711,8.28213858381503,9.32325063583815,5.15,1.72512647554806,14.4108699409268,13.9093975117632,13.816653826392,8.81665382639197,5.72650298651252,6.51952996146435,11.85,-479.727255445087,-243.947127129094,76,25.95,1.52215799614644,519,20,76,63,25,33,19,8,55,25.95,20.76,8.2381,3.15,3.04,2.52,0.5238,1.32,1.25,0.76,0.32,0.127,2.2,0.873,10,French,Sciences et proprietes de la matiere,Oui,1,0.25,1,1.5,Non,1999,L2,20,Anglais,B1,jamais,F

cohort_student184,"<p>In chemistry, there are so much experitment to understand the world and how it works but I choose a simple experitment to make copper in evidence.</p><p>When we have a liquid in chemistry  and that we want to proove the presence of copper in this solution, we can put in a nail of iron,  and if we have copper in it we will observe a sediment of copper on the nail. Why have we a sediment on the nail ? Because the potentiel electric of the couple Cu<sup>2+ </sup>/ Cu is higher than the potentiel electric of the couple Fe<sup>2+</sup> /Fe. In chemistry the potentiel electric allows us to preview an reaction before really doing it. In chemistry this couple of iron and copper are couple redox so a oxidant react with a reducer in exchange of electron.

cohort_student185,"<p></p><p>We
all know that the ocean is something which facinate everbody because
of his importance in the Hearth and also by his secret. Indeed, the
ocean is one of the place the most unknown of the hearth, (around
80 % are still inexplored) and more particulary his very depth
seabed.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Last
year, scientists of the Newcastle university, in England, discovered
a new type of fish that we never had the chance to see before. This
discovery was made by a scientific robot. They are called the slug
fish.</p>
<p>Indeed,
it’s a weird fish which had adapted his-self in a depth life in the
Atacama fosse in the Pacific.</p>
<p>They
have a jelly et translucid body that allows them to be more resistent
of the high pression and low temperature of the seabed.</p>
<p>Moreover,
the condition of life in this type of place is very hard, that why
the nature give them some tips like strong teeth and bones to
compense the lack of gravity.</p>
<p>And
the most particular discovery on those animals, is, if they try to go
up the sea, his body melt beacause if the difference of gravity and
environnement.</p>
<p>This
new discovery show that we have some many species unknow in the
seabed and the curiosity of humans have no limit so maybe one day we
will know all about the most facinate place.</p><br /><p></p><p>The
limit of this discovery, for me, is that humans are so enthousiast
about their discovery that lead to discover more and more species
from this special place. And try to make the same mistakes than
before, to put them in a auqarium and to make it attracive.</p><br />",A2,0.774193548387097,0.946904891207309,8.6210544972852,6.09600609600914,39.4277690123205,0.926155075661186,131.373569198751,0.00511408339889851,0.0521602363223985,0.159257134857765,6.1654311580862,14.1964298764903,10.4288043478261,61.9021739130435,7.73478260869565,-4.15102188089277,184173420.970304,55.0282608695652,52.5427536231884,53.7791847826087,8.32823825282608,8.32913043478261,27.1336231884058,8.26711884057971,7.19071739130435,5.81887496969697,88.026766969697,-393.940808702503,515.102188089277,6.33333333333333,-53.7033043478261,57.8160869565217,6.34555797101449,10.9089855072464,14.5623188405797,7.50759323478261,38.75,9.1304347826087,8.47347826086956,99.4166666666667,12.3333333333333,39.6666666666667,6.24958550724638,7.01365797101449,7.23923768115942,8.09435072463768,3.83333333333333,1.75398824517212,13.1603527881616,12.7398849367051,12.6176920308357,7.61769203083567,5.52171014492754,6.26315942028985,10.25,-424.39444115942,-221.900331050725,63.3333333333333,23,1.48550724637681,277,12,32,24,14,11,9,6,37,23.0833,19.7857,11.5417,2,2.2857,1.7143,0.4583,0.7857,1.1667,0.6429,0.4286,0.25,2.6429,1.5417,12,French,Sciences et proprietes de la matiere,Oui,5,1,3,1,Oui,15,L2,19,Anglais,B1,jamais,F

However it's a method which are a little accessible today. <br />Stem cells can save life today. I have an example to show that. A guy who are 30 years old worked in a laboratory. He was a victim to one experiments and he was burnt with acid. More than 80% of their body was burn and the docotors thought he was died. Fortunately he have a twin brother and due to him, the doctors took cells of skin of their twin and with the stem cells the cells of the skin proliferate fastly. Thanks to that, the guy is safe. <br />The consequences to the discover of the stem cells is that can cured deases. I think it's a great thing to cured deases like that. <br />I think in the

There were also people who had an accident and they couldn't do anything because they were disfigured and they had to live with that.</p><p>       Plastic surgery has been an exceptional discovery for these people because they found a solution to their problems. Let me give you an example : Michael Jackson. He was an afro american star and he didn't like his skin colour, and he also had a disease, the vitiligo which consists in a skin depigmentation so he decided to do plastic surgery and he became white. Plastic surgery changed his life for the best (for himself) but some detractors will say that he was ugly as a white peson.</p><p>      Plastic urgery is also a solution for serious burned people. It can be people who tried to immolate themself or also people who had and accident like a car crash who stayed in a fire for a while. We can practice plastic surgery on them to reimplant tissues, to give them a new skin, and forth and so on...</p><p>       There are also people that use it to remplace a part of their body because they find it ugly like their nose, their breast. It's a really expensive surgery but people don't care about the price. More and more people want to do plastic surgery, specially young adult. Everybody wants to become really beautiful htat's why they will pay to have a better nose, a better chin.</p><p><br /></p><p>               That's why plastic surgery is a extraordinary discovery because it helps many kinds of people. From sick people to rich people who wants to become handsome.</p><p>     </p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Plastic surgery is a really interesting speciality if it is used to help people in a death danger (like people who had an accident). However, it has some defaults. It can be used by the wrong people, and it can be too much used by very rich people. I think the government has to pute some regulations on the plastic surgery, in order to be not missused by the wrong persons.</p>",C1,0.619883040935672,0.906990323825101,8.10602259675985,5.73182354662028,24.0082129325248,0.878478622875982,236.312027632434,0.0178878568971448,0.119152173706955,0.204089227988509,4.80897267687464,11.0730687983872,8.2439010989011,57.5131868131868,6.08879120879121,-3.21203176261634,85365978.7140379,49.0857142857143,48.8961538461538,54.0373912087912,8.25748865922637,8.25824175824176,35.7826593406593,7.14196725274725,6.25576615384615,5.47600330578512,87.2052669421488,-334.631811576923,421.203176261634,5.85,-48.9049642857143,63.3213406593407,5.93806,8.94865934065934,11.8953846153846,6.03234213538462,39.268,9.82142857142857,9.23357142857143,79.5,8.4,37.7054945054945,5.95878175824176,6.59630593406593,5.77154615384615,6.30707384615385,3.55,1.70643939393939,11.4076558523211,11.1141665554836,10.9372539331938,5.93725393319377,4.68592527472527,5.31893626373626,8.07,-371.664772901099,-231.439818406593,58.5,18.2,1.47802197802198,370,19,61,47,28,18,14,4,42,19.4737,13.2143,7.8723,2.4737,2.1786,1.6786,0.383,0.6429,1.4737,0.5,0.1429,0.0851,1.5,0.8936,8,French,Medecine,Oui,9,2,4,15,Oui,1999,L2,19,Anglais,C1,mensuelle,M

You might thus ask yourself why they are used and what their risks can be? </p><p><br /></p><p>To begin with, students use those drugs to boost their mental capacities and stay awake for longer. These drugs used are normally prescribed to people suffering from ADHD, narcolepsy or even dementia. They are proven to work on these sock patients by making narcoleptic pateints saty awake for longer for example. However, no study has shown that they could boost healthy people's energy. It has even been proven that they could impair  rather than boost mental performance. </p><p><br /></p><p>Secondly, smart pills have many side effects. Amongst those are seizures, loss of appetite, depression and many more. One of the worst ones is addiction. In fact, students using smart drugs are more likely to use other highly addictive and illicit drugs. It is very hard for students using those brain enhancers to withdraw them and most of them need help ffrom doctors to do so. Moreover one of the major risks of smart drugs is intercations since most students buy smart pilss illegaly and thus get no supervision form doctors. SInce they have no supervision, most of them are not aware that for instance alcohol and contraceptives cannot be taken with those smart pills. Since people taking brain enhancers are mostly students, they are very likely to be taking alcohol regularly as well as contraceptives. Finally, insomnia is a long term side effect of these drugs. Since the brain consolidates memories, creates new brain cells and cleans toxins away during our sleep, insomnia is derimental to brain health. </p><p>I think smart pills are very dangerous because of all the side effects they can cause. Moreover, its is not even proven that they help with studying for exams, which is why they are taken by studnets. they cause more harm than good. Not only are they dangerous for your health but also for your safety. since those drugs ae bought illegaly, you could get some problems with the police. You can get up to 5 years of jail in the UK. Finally, I am against those smart pills beacuse they create inequlities amongst students. Brain enhancers are quite expensive, not all students can buy them. The main problem is that people that would not normally take those pills are gonna feel like they need to take them to stay competitive since many other people are taking them. Therefore smart pills are dangerous, create inequalities and people feel the need to take them because of others taking them to stay competitive. </p>",C2,0.595833333333333,0.905523005561121,9.23061030846101,6.52702714360323,25.1935537942146,0.885558317788976,115.625,0.00742677824267782,0.0675980251708066,0.199230251582342,5.07977946178391,11.6966244644009,9.84452655889146,60.5324711316397,8.33631408775982,-3.07216136492222,74696729.6919183,47.6493071593534,48.0176674364896,45.041645034642,10.7223590939279,10.7231408775982,28.792848960739,8.36102234642032,7.12695467898383,5.995079,82.795554,-355.358166640215,407.216136492222,5.76,-48.0295690531178,61.4759852193995,6.01688237413395,8.98743279445728,11.7316951501155,5.84189055892841,45.0042,9.98845265588914,9.41729792147806,83.16,8.32,36.2576443418014,5.75663148267898,6.34955887297922,5.74339718244804,6.20252687297921,3.28,1.66634522661524,11.3681398469725,11.0777566502885,10.8993670632526,5.8993670632526,5.5385537182448,6.20075048498845,7.848,-389.428103369977,-261.998079930716,57.6,17.32,1.51039260969977,438,27,65,49,29,19,12,8,47,16.2222,15.1034,8.9388,1.8148,2.2414,1.6897,0.3878,0.6552,1.0741,0.4138,0.2759,0.1633,1.6207,0.9592,10,French,Medecine,Oui,8,2,6,10,Oui,2000,L2,18,Anglais,C1,quotidienne,F

The
discovery of the wheel<br />
The
wheel has traveled the world throught all the century and the time.
We don’t know all the exact date of this discover because this
invention is very old. However, different traces like research in
archeology have permitted us to date the first presence of the wheel
in the humanity. Indeed in 1974 in Pologne, one of the oldest trace
of wheel has been discover and we estimate his age at about -3500
years before JC. It was used at the beggining just as trolley, but
it’s amazing how in short time it evolved. In some centuries, human
reach to create wood wheel and wooden vehicle.  After that we saw
just a little evolution of this objet. But many of application have
been found and very usefull to all human’s field, like science,
mechanics… Today we still use it, and try to optimise it, for
example in order to minimize the waste of energy.</h3>

cohort_student199,"<p lang=""en-us"" xml:lang=""en-us"">Quantification
of energy has always been a key idea in physics and is now teach
practical classes of physics. An experiment to understood this
abstract concept is the analysis of light using diffraction. It is
based on the fact that lights rays are emit by atoms when they
desexcites, liberating energy. It goes to a final quantum state of
energy from an initial quantum state and free energy under the form
of a particle of photon, which is a no mass particle. 
</p>
<p lang=""en-us"" xml:lang=""en-us"">The
purpose of the experiment is to use the diffraction of the light
emits by a hydrogen luminescent tube to find the quantification
states of the hydrogen atom for each quantum number. This technique
involve a goniometer, which is a device that diffract light with a
network and then gives us the angular diffraction of fundamental rays
of this particular light. Furthermore the atoms are excite by an
electrical field, it passes in the tube filled with gaze of the
element we are working on and by giving energy to them as so
detestation appears as they cannot stay excite.</p>
<p lang=""en-us"" xml:lang=""en-us"">First
to start on the hydrogen state of energy we need to find a crucial
parameter: the number of string of the network that diffract the
light. So we know the light rays he emits by the mercury element and
can retrace their wave length, we are using a mercury luminescent
tube to determine the parameter. Thanks to a physical formula
including this wave length, the number of string and the sinus of the
angle of the diffracted light obtained by the goniometer, we are able
to approach this number and continue the experiment.</p>
<p lang=""en-us"" xml:lang=""en-us"">In a
second time, we replace the mercury tube by a hydrogen one and repeat
the process through the goniometer. At this time we are just able to
pick up the values of the angle of the rays and using the same
formula as the first part of this experiment we can calculate the
final wave length. 
</p>
<p lang=""en-us"" xml:lang=""en-us"">Moreover
other formulas of physics help us is our research of the values of
energy as well as Energy=(Plank constant*speed of light)/wave length.

cohort_student203,"<p></p><h2> <strong>X-Ray Imaging</strong></h2>It’s hard to imagine proper and correct diagnosis and treatment of injuries as common as fractures without X-ray imaging technology. X-Rays were accidentally discovered when a German physicist Röntgen was studying the process of electric current passing through a gas of extremely low pressure. He observed that in a darkened room, the cathode ray tube covered with barium platinocyanide caused a fluorescent effect. Since the cathode rays are invisible, he didn’t know what the rays were and named it X-radiation for its unknown nature. He won the first-ever Nobel Prize in Physics in 1901 for his discovery. The initial reception to the discovery, however, was met with hostility and mockery with a New York Times journalist referring to it as ""an alleged discovery of a method to photograph the invisible"".<br /><p>On my point of view, X-ray imaging are an amazing invention but when it was invented, the scientists did not know the adverse effects of the X-Ray. </p><p>But there is a lot of adverse effects of this type of medecine because of there ray are nuclear radiation.

cohort_student204,"<p></p><p>During this year’s first semester, me and a classmate chose a topic related to  materials’ evolution through the ages, for a project on one of our Engineering classes.</p>
<p>Since the early 1900s, men were driven by the idea of being able to fly, and since then, the design and the mechanics of airplanes has changed and evolved exponentially.</p>
<p>The very first airplanes that were designed were inspired from the famous “First Flight” prototype built by the Wright Brothers, Kitty Hawk, the first powered aircraft. These planes were all made of wood, because of his incredible resistance and thickness; although through the years the goal set by aeronautical engineers, was to improve the capacities of the aircraft, reduce fuel consomption and more importantly, reduce the weight of the aircraft.</p>
<p>Weight plays a very important role in the aerodynamics of an airplane: if the aircraft is too “heavy”, it would require more energy, therefore more fuel, in the more demanding phase of a flight: the takeoff.</p>
<p>Thanks to the advanced technology and the work of brilliant engineers all over the world, the aircraft industry was able to find a way of developing “mixes” of different elements in order to obtain different properties from different materials. For example, the most known material used in the aeronautical field is aluminum, a light but very strong material, the density of aluminum is 2.7, as in it is 2.7 times more dense than water. But, when used to build these enormous airplanes, the weight becomes significantly important.</p>
<p>Which is why, engineers started to develop composite materials. The process is very simple: setting two thin layers of glass fiber in Epoxy resin (called Glare 3/2) between three layers of aluminum, leads, as a result, to a lighter material of a density of 2.34.</p>
<p>This is one of the many ways engineers of companies like Boeing are able to improve the characteristics of aircrafts. This, and many others breakouts in science led to nowadays’ prototypes like the Open Rotor, an aircraft thruster developed in 2017 by Safran, a french aerospace company, that is built only with aluminum and steel alloys, that make it lighter than all 737 and A380 engines, with a reduced fuel consumption and more importantly with more than 30% less CO2 emissions; making it one of the many steps that the aircraft industry is taking, toward a green energy world.</p><br /><p></p><p>This project made me realize how much i am interested and invested in the engineering world. Because one of the many qualities that an engineer mind must have, is to be able to think outside of the box and to have a large imagination, cause these kinds of ideas are the ones that at first are thought of as impossible or even laughed at; but in the end they are the solution to a better world.</p><p>Just look at Elon Musk for example, he went from ending up in debts because of his ""meaningless"" investments, to being one of the most recognized brilliant minds of our time.</p><br />",B2,0.760617760617761,0.950758898795608,12.2409843902236,8.65568307072581,49.0098658448773,0.942684382986269,71.4062104023494,0.00329232887372422,0.0454365371507914,0.142842763330456,7.40314051684204,17.0463609954207,17.4995238095238,75.8857142857143,14.2304761904762,-6.23307710979185,622371389.315432,44.9904761904762,41.4865079365079,44.2305880952381,10.9445919395524,10.9457142857143,17.8199682539683,9.12524253968254,8.06559333333333,7.33582903909874,85.3304562756793,-554.553162632757,723.307710979185,11.8666666666667,-64.5867261904762,39.4524285714286,7.57923555555556,16.1036825396825,19.6304761904762,10.5633941028571,109.38,10.297619047619,9.75738095238095,157.866666666667,20.8,58.0047619047619,9.63696761904762,10.2283533333333,9.87199523809524,11.4778266666667,8.2,1.66224882428388,16.1561658246591,15.5503135318929,15.4899959967968,10.4899959967968,7.39285396825397,8.3750126984127,15.88,-590.399672634921,-267.195172063492,118.666666666667,33.6,1.57539682539683,504,15,50,35,19,16,13,12,64,33.6,26.5263,14.4,2.3333,2.6316,1.8421,0.4571,0.8421,1.2667,0.6842,0.6316,0.3429,3.3684,1.8286,14,Italian,Sciences et proprietes de la matiere,Oui,0,0,0,11,Non,1999,L2,19,Anglais,C1,quotidienne,M

Immunotherapy is already known and used in medecine but they discovered a new method to create antibody. <br /></div><div style=""text-align:left;""><br /></div><div style=""text-align:left;"">Immunotherapy is based on the princip that we can create in vitro antibody to implat them on a patient to cure him. An antibody is a protein made physiologicaly by the body to defend himself against virus and bacteries. Its a protein with 4 part : 2 heavy-chains and 2 light-chains in a strucure in Y. There is a constant part and 2 variables parts. The constant part can be reconized by the immunity cells, and the variable part is specific to an unique antigen (a molecule specific of what isn't physiologicaly in our body). So in a way, it's coud be possible to create antibody against almost every thing : for example, it would be possible to use an antibody against the the oestrogen receptor on mammary cells, receptor which is overexpressed in the mammary cancer.</div><div style=""text-align:left;""><br /></div><div style=""text-align:left;"">To create an antibody, there is different possibilities but the more efficient is to to take a B-lymphocyte (the cells whose secrets anti body) from a healthy people, then to activate him with the molecule we want him to create antibody against, and to modify his DNA to make it cancerous and to implant it in a mouse, and so he will multiply and we would be able to take plenty of anti body in the mouse's blood.<br /></div><br /><p>I think immunotherapy is a fabulous way to cure people, and offer plenty of opportunities with incurable disease. However, we need to take care about the power it gives and we need to stay focus on the good way to use it. Moreover, we need to take a look at the mousetreatment which is not so good with a cancer.<br /></p>",B1,0.683098591549296,0.923097381190225,8.14005917547788,5.75589104224019,27.9871918238171,0.895606987852904,150.7637373537,0.00809109979023075,0.0690441553272578,0.189025474871027,5.16626607693772,11.8957672551976,11.7155,64.45,8.9,-4.54482239120263,241636228.406419,46.69,44.53,52.097398,8.78905455840799,8.79,21.7333333333333,9.03453333333333,7.7987,6.0780969342252,87.6041139910814,-421.799791536723,554.482239120263,8.5,-55.83666,42.716,7.2041,13.512,16.9333333333333,8.43219,49,10.1,9.54,109.583333333333,17.3333333333333,46.6666666666667,8.1324,8.7492,8.78396666666667,9.70326666666667,5.41666666666667,1.69171779141104,15.021129683784,14.4821835085682,14.4017542509914,9.40175425099138,6.41733333333333,7.23066666666667,12.3,-462.709373666667,-242.995881166667,85,25,1.64,303,12,44,26,18,8,10,6,33,25.25,16.8333,11.6538,2.1667,2.4444,1.4444,0.3077,0.4444,1.5,0.5556,0.3333,0.2308,1.8333,1.2692,10,French,Medecine,Oui,10,2.5,3,0,Non,2000,L2,19,Anglais,C1,hebdomadaire,M

transport takes a huge place in the international market and
globalization. That is why, industry of boats has increased a lot
these last decades. Many engineers work in order to improve the
performance of cargoes. The problem that they had to solve was
because of the contact between steel, sea and oxygen, it creates
oxidation. They created an anode, made of zinc, which protects the
steel. So, the question is: How this anode does it work?</p>
<p lang=""en-us"" xml:lang=""en-us""><br /></p>
<p lang=""en-us"" xml:lang=""en-us"">	First
of all, we have to have a look on the reactions. Steel is commonly
named with its atomic symbol: Fe. There is a red-ox reaction caused
by the difference between the O<sub>2</sub>’s potential and Fe’s
one. In that way, we have: Fe → Fe<sup>2+ </sup>+ e<sup>- </sup>
and O<sub>2 </sub>+ H<sup>+</sup> + 4e<sup>-</sup> → 2H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>
<p lang=""en-us"" xml:lang=""en-us"">Steel
is not still steel. It becomes ions. With O2, it is transformed in
Fe(OH)2, a red oxide. 
</p>
<p lang=""en-us"" xml:lang=""en-us""><br /></p>
<p lang=""en-us"" xml:lang=""en-us"">	Then,
the fact that sea water is salted, there are the ions: Na+ and Cl-.
They increase conduction and the share of electrons. Therefor,
oxidation of Fe becomes more important. 
</p>
<p lang=""en-us"" xml:lang=""en-us"">So, it
was necessary to find a way to reduce or stop this corrosion. 
</p>
<p lang=""en-us"" xml:lang=""en-us""><br /></p>
<p lang=""en-us"" xml:lang=""en-us"">	We
have seen that scientists invented the anode made of zinc. How does
it protect our steel?</p>
<p lang=""en-us"" xml:lang=""en-us"">Zinc
(Zn) has a smaller electric potential than Fe. Indeed, in red-ox, the
oxidant “attacks” the reduction which has the most negative
potential. Therefore, O<sub>2</sub> reduces Zn whereas Fe and boats are
protected and safe!</p>
<p lang=""en-us"" xml:lang=""en-us""><br /></p>
<p lang=""en-us"" xml:lang=""en-us""><br /></p>
<p lang=""en-us"" xml:lang=""en-us"">	To
conclude, steel is protected thanks to zinc because of their
difference of electric potentials. On order to avoid corrosion, a
piece of zinc is melted on the steel.</p><br /><p> </p><p lang=""en-us"" xml:lang=""en-us""><sup></sup>According to me, the invention of the sacrificed anode had a
huge impact on the maritime market. Their life-during increased,
their maintenance price decreased. It favours globalization. 
</p>
<p lang=""en-us"" xml:lang=""en-us"">Nevertheless,
with some accidents, such has recently the “crash” of America
Grande rised the question: Is it really good to let these boats
navigate during three of four decades?</p>",C2,0.706214689265537,0.932800244729673,9.39557535003536,6.64367504315917,33.452104956615,0.914121349223282,126.081266558141,0.00699794555726759,0.0678831838956755,0.172897325218146,5.81838509232067,13.3973267788764,5.29755372945638,51.6115676359039,3.77914032869785,-1.99133820209064,20166280.189908,51.7358407079646,55.3715339233038,56.5671843657817,7.56431521503835,7.5647197640118,26.7817646439107,9.03456590813316,7.49807774968394,4.98768444632291,86.4638412510566,-262.067856921239,299.133820209064,3.64285714285714,-42.6878650442478,69.7674889380531,5.449950168563,6.53591550779604,10.5065739570164,4.65086577914033,24.8330357142857,9.51327433628319,8.8946017699115,53.1428571428571,6.85714285714286,34.2310366624526,5.08465351875263,5.78482555836494,5.38740894437421,5.40796687737042,2.67857142857143,1.6788370520622,10.6088406372146,10.3808786751884,10.1713716560064,5.17137165600636,5.26850705857564,5.84404224610198,5.35714285714286,-293.751341205225,-222.609480884956,36.4285714285714,12.1071428571429,1.47492625368732,339,27,48,39,29,8,7,7,40,12.5556,11.6897,8.6923,1.4444,1.6552,1.3448,0.2051,0.2759,1.0741,0.2414,0.2414,0.1795,1.3793,1.0256,11,French,Sciences et proprietes de la matiere,Oui,0,1,2,6,Oui,1999,L2,20,Anglais,B2,hebdomadaire,F

we synthesize the two product of the main reaction. It consist of putting
together salisylic acid and acetic anhydrid in a balloon and we heat it to
around sixty degrees in a water bath during 30 minutes. Then, when all the
products are mixed together by heat, we put in on a filter; which is under
pressure and called “Buchner filter”.</span></p>

<p><span lang=""en-gb"" xml:lang=""en-gb"">Then, we made two different products:
the acetylsalisylic acid (or aspirin) and acetic acid (which gives it smell to
vinegar). Our next step is to separate these two products to purify then later.
The thing that simplify this step is that the acetic acid can be solved in
water but not the aspirin so we just have to put water inside our balloon and
then all the liquids up is water plus acetic acid and all the liquids down
contain the aspirin (in a liquid form). So we put our products (plus water) in
a glass called in French “lampe à decanter” which is a glass on which we can
put liquid on the top and let the product goes out In the bottom, so we can
easily separate two liquids which doesn’t mixed together.</span></p>

aspirin by warm it again with a mix of ethanol and water. The mix will extract
from the aspirin the traces of water and products from the beginning, which
doesn’t react. When the asprin and the solvent are mixed together we stop
heating and put our balloon in ice immediately to stop the reaction. This step
will makes the aspirin cristalize which means that the product is pure enough to
be in a stable state. We just have to put the mix on the Buchner filter again
and take the cristals.</span></p>

cohort_student211,"<p></p><p lang=""en-gb"" xml:lang=""en-gb"">Let’s
talk about chemistry history.</p>
<p lang=""en-gb"" xml:lang=""en-gb"">By the
end of Middle-Age, Alchemistry was a wide spread trend. People
apprehended matter as divided into four categories (or elements),
distinct one from the others. They distinguished “water”,
“earth”, “fire”, and “air”. It was impossible to pass
from one to the other, unless we used what people called a
Philosopher Stone. Only this could allow you to turn something from
one element into an other. Obviously, everyone wanted to discover
this very special stone. In fact, it could not only transform silver
in gold, but it could also heal any illness. It was a very valuable
thing, but at the end, no one found the recipe and it became a
legend. Step by step, as scientists made experiments, alchemistry
slowly turned into what we now know as chemistry.</p>
<p lang=""en-gb"" xml:lang=""en-gb"">One of
the most famous experience that made alchemistry turn into chemistry
is the experience of the grown tree. A Dutch scientist had the idea
of putting a tree into a pot, and watering it. He started his
experiment, assuming that water was of the “water” element, and
the tree was of “earth” element since once it dies, it turns into
dirt. That being set, he measured the weight of dirt in the pot, the
weight of the tree itself and the amount of water he put everyday. I
can’t recall the exact numbers, but after 5 years, he stopped the
experiment, and measured again. The dirt in the pot was of almost the
same weight, he had used a lot of water, and the tree had grown a
lot, but not enough to meet with the weight of water used. He proved
thereby the existence of what he called “Sylvester gas”, and
destroyed the theory of matter divided into four elements. It was the
first step to discover Photosynthesis.</p><p>History is interesting, and discovering never stops.</p>",C2,0.69811320754717,0.929102230665459,8.8028726014714,6.22457091042169,31.0503016524095,0.906808734109276,126.181717495352,0.00636891967200064,0.0600763076472432,0.179459762290915,5.53054576463949,12.7345522337802,7.60815789473684,56.2237680187731,5.67549446865571,-2.88345030471216,61724975.9171461,48.6455414012739,49.3238853503185,53.7220356687898,8.34389733860892,8.34458598726115,37.4694535702313,6.97053647334898,6.09134039557492,5.39424511518413,86.613285690264,-318.382895785821,388.345030471216,5.36842105263158,-47.2116309084814,62.3525092189072,5.95131870600067,8.66800201139792,11.9608447871271,5.76280836500168,31.3873684210526,9.87261146496815,9.28987261146497,72.8947368421052,8.84210526315789,33.4052966811934,5.65571592356688,6.27079001005699,5.99711156553805,6.36670794502179,2.78947368421053,1.65173410404624,11.6227190910093,11.3125448262834,11.1434507104596,6.14345071045955,4.64339758632249,5.25073918873617,7.48421052631579,-353.604957378478,-232.353342197452,53.6842105263158,16.5263157894737,1.50955414012739,314,19,47,37,26,10,7,5,31,16.5263,12.0769,8.4865,1.9474,1.8077,1.4231,0.2703,0.3846,1.3684,0.2692,0.1923,0.1351,1.1923,0.8378,13,French,Sciences et proprietes de la matiere,Oui,9,2,1,20,Non,1994,L2,24,Anglais,B2,quotidienne,M

<p align=""left"">	Let me
talk about starlite. Starlite is a new material invented in the 80’s
by a english chemist. Starlite's
composition is a closely guarded secret, but it is said to contain a
variety of organic polymers
 looks like paint. Thanks to his properties, many international
organisations wanted to test it and make profit of it, for exemple
the english ministery of defence, NATO... This material seems like a
mix of metal and ceramic. When starlite is warmed, a coat of carbon
is created to protect the material.</p>
<p align=""left""><br /></p>
<p align=""left"">	Its
properties make it interesting and scientists afirm it’s
incredible. Starlite has a high-temperature resistance and it can be
warmed at 10 000 degrees celsium. The most famous experiment has been
done in the 80’s. A scientist put starlite on a egg and he started
to warm it. Starlite protected the egg and when scientist opened it,
it was liquid.

The curve of the experience shows a straight line so we deduced that the sensitivity of the cell is proportional to the wave lenght. But the problem is that the efficiency is not so high.

Futhermore, they didn’t need to built it at any times they use it like for the first. Now, he is too small that doc and vet can take it with them  to visit patient and animals at home. </p>

the same part of the first one and cut the DNA of its agressor. The
scientists use this capacity to cut the DNA of an interested plant in
order to switch off a gene or to insert a new gene. Then the DNA past
the wound. In nature, the pasting leads to mistakes which kill the

cells and the controled conditions permit to get cells which could be
usable.</p><p></p><p></p><p>This technology is a
good way to replace the old GMOs which contain antibiotic resistance
genes used for the selection of the good transformed plants. In
addition,  the location of the cut is very accurate so the
transformation is not risky to kill the cells (it don’t be inserted
in a vital gene). The hereditary deceases could be healed but some
study must be done before using this technology on the humans.
Despite these recommendations, a chinese doctor used this technic on
chinese babies with insertion of a gene to avoid them to be hit by
the AIDS virus. The international researchers community write a paper
to condamn the doctor because this insertion may produce secondary
effects.

These robots can be chars, drones...<br /></p><p>The robots in general are quite fascinating but a few years ago, I watched a footage which showed one military robot in action and I was really impressed. The robot I saw in the footage was ""Atlas"". Developped by the company Boston Dynamics this robot is as tall as a human and can carry many things, walk, run, jump... But what suprised me the most is that it can fall and raise again. Robots of this type are still in developpement and we can wait for more surprising fonctionnalities.<br /></p><p>The military robots can be very helpful for all the armed forces in the world. Thanks to these robots, militaries take fewer risks on the battle ground and can give to robots their heavy packages. It can be helpful to recognize a field, a home where terrorists hide. In addition, to create these robots, people are needed so it creates an increase of the hiring in the domain of Information &amp; technologies.<br /></p><p>But these evolutions can also lead to a sort of war of technology in which the poorest countries loose. <br /></p>",B2,0.792452830188679,0.95011786568362,8.15880124380102,5.76914368584494,40.6018285508631,0.927493652237534,215.379138483446,0.0122192273135669,0.098148621710051,0.156937671088379,6.1697158197694,14.2062956746106,8.19253333333334,57.3466666666667,6.38666666666667,-2.9189252460397,64023664.023993,47.335,48.07,51.324292,9.000888694832,9.0016,29.7,8.25276666666667,7.03253333333333,5.56363500837521,85.4397832495812,-333.521081333333,391.89252460397,5.58333333333333,-47.3703316666667,59.6343333333334,6.10076666666667,9.082,11.6666666666667,5.71439333333333,19.3333333333333,10.025,9.4575,75.3333333333333,8.33333333333333,35.1666666666667,6.04686666666667,6.65208333333333,5.76435,6.16366666666667,3.08333333333333,1.62942477876106,11.374738998889,11.0838361888699,10.9056941504209,5.90569415042095,5.13566666666667,5.769,7.7,-362.135910333333,-241.4077988,55.8333333333333,16.6666666666667,1.54,200,10,27,21,15,6,7,4,23,20,13.3333,9.5238,2.1,1.8,1.4,0.2857,0.4,1.5,0.4667,0.2667,0.1905,1.5333,1.0952,10,French,Informatique et electronique,Oui,0,0,0,7,Non,1998,L3,20,Anglais,B2,hebdomadaire,F

cohort_student238,"<p>The autonomous car is one of the fastest evolving technologies. I remember in my childhood, seeing these prototypes on tv with huge computers in the boot and visible radars everywhere. It was like this would not arrive before a very long time. But in ten years, progress have been huge !</p><p>Scientists and car manufacturers are now able to industrialize these technologies. It is now possible to have all the onboard safety features integrated with a minimal impact on style and a better reliability. <br /></p><p>However, our cars are still not able to drive by themeselves in all conditions. It is currently only possible on highway or traffic jams. Having a completly autonomous car is still a long way in front of us because we also need to adapt our road infrastructures to communicate with the cars (for example at traffic lights).</p><p>I am very confident these improvements will be made at some point and maybe in a not to distant future. Each year new discoveries are made and help this technology to go forward !<br /></p><p>We often think the autonomous car is a robot that drives the car all by itself. This could be the ultimate vision but some of the autonomous car technologies have been already largely implemented in lots of our cars. To identify the evolutions, cars are classified on a scale from zero to five. Zero beeing fully manual and five full automation.</p><p>Currently, most modern cars are of level one, two or three. One is a low level where cars can only manage steering or speed but not both. At level two and three they can do it at the same time. Three beeing less restrictive. The goal is not only the final objective of the fully autonomous car but improving the driver's safety all along the researches. Cars are way safer than before, especially in slippery conditions or traffic jams with the different driving assistance systems.</p><p>Some boldier experimentations are also driven. For example, some little shuttles are going to be commissioned on campus in just a few days. It will show to the students and staff how could be our future means of transportation on small distances. The manufacturer will be able to test it in real conditions with regular cars driving on the same roads (it is a national first because normally this kind of vehicles are segregated from traffic). They have a very high grade of automation, so if it works well, it will improve the confidence of the public in these technologies.</p><p>One problem that we will have to solve is the legal situation of the autonomous car. Who is responsible in case of an accident ? The car or the driver ? If the car has to made a difficult choice, for example, killing the driver or a pedestrian, what happens ? In France, we don't even have a law that allows fully autonomous cars to be sold to individuals. This will have consequences on our vision of road safety but also our ethics.<br /></p>",C1,0.716599190283401,0.939514410004703,11.2622403046713,7.9636064907855,39.5581320021136,0.928483942150609,95.2318510383714,0.00549685658799908,0.062237188157185,0.158994504040909,6.56324590430506,15.1124321809071,7.96302730460922,56.8602830661323,6.34852204408818,-2.71131633133159,51314562.2318973,47.3776553106212,48.7193386773547,50.371575751503,9.26193675778517,9.26260521042084,33.4407133016032,7.70085180360721,6.60380192885771,5.54281285140562,84.8299714859438,-318.342196376503,371.131633133159,5.21875,-46.2807925225451,57.9191673972946,6.16810938126252,9.05468875250501,12.4098446893788,5.71410730608718,49.41359375,10.0200400801603,9.45204408817635,71.5,9.625,36.2350325651303,6.0774253006012,6.68288678607214,6.42837370365731,6.68292845691383,3.21875,1.64304461942257,11.9907646115445,11.6528417970292,11.4963227339832,6.49632273398321,4.86287781813627,5.46777887024048,7.359375,-356.063313647295,-249.193543126252,52.1875,15.59375,1.57314629258517,501,32,60,46,33,12,12,13,64,15.6562,15.1818,10.8913,1.4375,1.8182,1.3939,0.2609,0.3636,1.0312,0.3636,0.3939,0.2826,1.9394,1.3913,12,French,Informatique et electronique,Oui,21,5,2,2,Oui,1998,L3,20,Anglais,C1,hebdomadaire,M
cohort_student239,"Virtual and Augmented Reality (respectivly VR and AR) are according to me one the biggest technological progress of the century.<p><br /></p><p>The VIrtual Reality consists in putting a kind of mask on his head that has a specific screen inside of it. The screen displays a video or an interactive world and the screen will move the image displayed depending on the movements of your head. So if you move your head to the right, the screen will show you what's on the right. The movements of your head are detected by captors in the room where you are.</p><p>Sometimes VR masks are used with controllers that allows you to move in the world displayed by the mask.</p><p><br /></p><p>The Augmented Reality is a little bit different because you don't need a specific mask but just a smartphone (or a device with a camera and a screen).</p><p>So the camera will film what's in front of it and thanks to artificial intelligence, it will add elements in the decor. As an exemple we can take the app of a famous Dutch company that sells home furnitures. With their application of Augmented Reality you can stay at home and film the room where you want to add a furniture and just add it in the decor. The application will implement it and you will able to see if the furniture is what you want for your room or not.</p>These technologies are already used in many industries like the automobile industrie or in medicine.",C2,0.683760683760684,0.920173579266794,7.39600261633639,5.22976360368491,25.9085380848829,0.885515097124702,164.365548980934,0.00795755968169761,0.0627419707858572,0.196461993224793,4.86088952702802,11.1926117636256,9.59470783532537,60.2154714475432,7.16586985391766,-3.74703428535804,135500364.789289,58.1715139442231,56.0101593625498,53.3010976095618,8.45923605058963,8.4600796812749,30.6431972111554,7.81938499335989,6.81463014608234,5.70954426666667,87.3950906666667,-368.816476022576,474.703428535804,5.25,-51.5497592961487,60.8954199867198,6.1315879814077,9.96192231075697,14.9005312084993,7.23524431062417,33.32625,8.76494023904382,8.07143426294821,91.3333333333333,13.6666666666667,40.8369853917663,6.69254555112882,7.5731275564409,7.71018515936255,8.34469774236388,4.16666666666667,1.66788655077768,13.6886701853816,13.2332051677165,13.1242283656583,8.12422836565829,5.54210790172643,6.25518227091633,9.25,-405.16647938911,-232.224187011952,52.5,20.9166666666667,1.47410358565737,254,12,30,26,14,11,10,7,22,21.1667,18.1429,9.7692,2.1667,2.1429,1.8571,0.4231,0.7857,1.1667,0.7143,0.5,0.2692,1.5714,0.8462,10,French,Informatique et electronique,Oui,0,0,0,4,Oui,1998,L3,19,Anglais,B2,jamais,M

cohort_student242,"<p>The autonomous shuttle is a recent invention, made for Beaulieu's campus. It does'nt use any driver, and can transport about 12 peoples. It's designed to be accessible by disabled people. There are lots of cameras and any other sensors around the vehicle to scan people walking/running next to. It stops at several checkpoints in the campus and doors open automaticly. This innovation is 100% electric, a good news for ecology. <br /></p><p>In my mind, this invention is kind of useless.

cohort_student243,"<p>During my biology's class, i studied contraception and in my opinion, it's a a huge important discovery for women. </p><p>This discovery  permits to scientifics a better understanding of women's body, especially to understanding all the homonals which are in our body and their differents functions. Indeed, there are differents homonals : some of them are for women and others for men. But, i will focus my description on women. </p><p>So like i said, for women, that's very important to understand our functionement and understand what we are and who we are. It exists many contraception and de most popular and used by girls is the pill. A pill is taken everyday during one month by a girl at the same hour. It is a very small pill that they can take with water or something to drink. Some women take without any drink. For a women, the contraception is linked to a cycle of differents hormonals molecules. So the cycle is repeted all the months. </p><p>To me, this is a very important discovery which permits to women to control ther contraception like they want. But, I also think that contraception are not only for girls especially the pill. In my opinion, the scientifics should work on pills for men because contraception concerns everybody. i konw that experience are realised but they doesn't find a pill yet. Moreover, this discovery permit to women understing what it is going on on their body and how they can give birth. </p>",B1,0.654867256637168,0.910453142043363,6.96133442603862,4.92240677875927,22.9274202393301,0.869584897360834,216.931631294541,0.0129582806573957,0.0904414153800162,0.208844193158318,4.51928542671169,10.4060392545316,8.04603658536585,57.0091463414634,6.50609756097561,-2.67137670495314,49043199.0393372,45.4524390243902,47.1231707317073,49.5935845528455,9.47510945818211,9.47577235772357,35.240843495935,7.41588861788618,6.39025731707317,5.58789724489796,84.2991025510204,-319.623439044715,367.137670495314,5.375,-46.082625,56.7635213414634,6.22518556910569,9.16153455284553,12.8166666666667,5.77685285,23.715,10.2439024390244,9.69829268292683,71.125,10.25,36.5132113821138,6.11545609756098,6.66829451219512,6.75287083333333,6.96393333333333,3.25,1.67519858781995,12.2739560335852,11.9153126626773,11.7678389583751,6.76783895837509,4.819375,5.41907012195122,7.33125,-358.036726504065,-259.78389195122,53.75,15.375,1.58943089430894,251,16,37,31,19,13,8,5,25,15.6875,13.2105,8.0968,1.9375,1.9474,1.6316,0.4194,0.6842,1.1875,0.4211,0.2632,0.1613,1.3158,0.8065,7,French,Sciences de la vie et de l'environnement,Oui,2,0,1,3,Oui,2000,L1,18,Anglais,B1,hebdomadaire,F
cohort_student244,"<p>The technologie that I choose is the VR (virtualy reality). This technology works with a headphone. This technology is used, in particulary, in the domain of video games. With this technology, gamers are totally immersed  in the world of the games. With the headphone, gamers doesn't see the real world and listen what happend around he, he only sees the games word and listens what happend in the games. This technology works with captors witch permits gamers to evolve in the games. For example, he can walk, jump ... <br /></p><p><br /></p><p>The goal of this technology is creating artificial words generated and 
managed by softwares to immersed people in a different word.<br /></p><p><br /></p><p>This technology is also used by companies to sell their products or services. For example, an attraction parc can use the VR to show a part of an attraction. If the customer find this experience good, he can buy their place for this attraction parc.</p><p><br /></p><p>This technology is used in the domain of the education. VR  permits to recreate things that be explained by the teacher and students can see that in the same time. So this technology permits to have a better comprehension method and do things that they can't do in the reality, for example, in chemistry, dangerous experience with products that the etablissement doesn't got.<br /></p><p><br /></p><p>One of the consequences of this technology, in the domain of video games, is gamers have the impression to be in the game. This consequence has good side, like the gamers has a better experience but also bad side, this consequence can increase the addiction of the video games.</p><p>This technology can have bad consequences in the health if VR is used during a long time in cause of waves produced by the headphone.</p><p><br /></p><p>Finally, I think that this technology is a good think and bad consequences can be avoid with a control use.<br /></p>",B1,0.56875,0.888808870540924,7.19418167688306,5.08705464881202,19.8228041515412,0.850855579745581,192.1875,0.0130503144654088,0.0907179089870848,0.22460398371567,4.27478753682842,9.84306205801786,9.10811718470882,59.1234369417649,7.40821722043587,-3.05069595434595,73123748.4347153,51.1448553054662,51.1818327974276,48.315815755627,9.82522321969517,9.8259807073955,27.6410342979636,8.55521411218292,7.26801664880314,5.7868711827957,84.2744215053763,-340.425009799928,405.069595434595,5.27777777777778,-47.9433849589139,57.3655796713112,6.23697027509825,9.55026259378349,13.4705966416577,6.26245452940336,34.1786111111111,9.58199356913183,8.97019292604501,80.3333333333333,11.3333333333333,40.1073597713469,6.75265473383351,7.47995180421579,7.03595557341908,7.39578485173276,3.94444444444444,1.7382271468144,12.7450848689565,12.3530514143324,12.2195444572929,7.21954445729289,5.12260146480886,5.76391264737406,8.08333333333333,-382.503854612362,-256.034274726688,52.7777777777778,17.2777777777778,1.55948553054662,314,17,40,31,19,10,9,6,41,18.4706,16.5263,10.129,1.8235,2.1053,1.6316,0.3226,0.5263,1.1176,0.4737,0.3158,0.1935,2.1579,1.3226,13,French,Informatique et electronique,Oui,0,0,0,2.5,Oui,1998,L3,20,Anglais,B1,hebdomadaire,F

cohort_student258,"<p></p><p>One of the best experience i had
were at l’Organisation Bretonne de Selection (OBS) in Plougoulm not so far from
Roscoff in Brittany. I worked, during an intership, on the micropropagation of
onion in a varietal creation context. We had to establish a culture medium
where seeds or any kind of onion’s tissues could grow and differenciate into a
new clone plant identical to the initial plant we used. First few weeks were
reading papers and finding informations about the experience, how scientists
already did it, even on another vegetable and how much time and money it costed.
Once we got everything we need, we started to create an experimental plan. We
created 6 culture medium with different concentration of hormones,
macroelements, microelements and vitamins. Then, we took some Onion’s
inflorescence and put it on the medium we made just after disinfected it. After
2 weeks of development, we were able to see cell clusters called
""cal"". We transplanted the explants onto fresh culture media, and
waited one month in the hope of obtaining a differentiation of the previously
obtained cells into tissues. After a few weeks, we could see buds. This was a
sign that the experiment was working, and that we would obtain plants from the
culture of the differentiated onion inflorescence tissue. To be honest, it was the
first time i worked on a lab, and it was a really great experience to see
plants growing thanks to the culture medium we made for it.</p><br /><p></p><p>The
consequences of this discovery were the use of the culture medium with the most
favourable cloning yields in a daily protocol still used in the laboratory
today. It is still a great moment to give your help and time to a company to
develop what could lead to new variety discoveries. This project had not been
shelved since other trainees were also able to contribute to this study after
me, with the aim of always improving the yields obtained from the culture of
clones. Thanks to this intership, i developed my own passion about de cell
biology and trying my best to integrate, in the future, a research lab and work
on it.</p><br />",B1,0.767567567567568,0.949327445036164,10.4400476337321,7.38222847772252,44.7416107204588,0.93646989178051,95.5441928414901,0.00417156286721504,0.0501215099834617,0.149501032681581,6.84812460419993,15.7683896285965,11.7454828767123,64.4097602739726,9.45650684931507,-4.13831520051033,182502165.082464,47.4321917808219,45.7650684931507,47.3917882191781,10.0784104607923,10.0793424657534,23.5333476027397,8.87772602739726,7.63298938356164,6.24290288461538,85.0713336538462,-414.212252247113,513.831520051033,7.625,-53.6071477739726,48.3203125,6.8519125,12.186875,15.5907534246575,7.72858871746575,53.5921875,10.013698630137,9.44506849315068,105.4375,14.75,45.0042808219178,7.76327739726027,8.40244606164384,8.02088809931507,8.80150684931507,5.0625,1.63442136498516,14.0992091892925,13.617352514586,13.5178419839813,8.51784198398131,5.91301113013699,6.67090496575342,10.95,-449.02338,-254.860212410959,76.25,22.8125,1.6,365,16,46,34,18,17,10,9,41,22.8125,20.2778,10.7353,2.125,2.5556,1.8889,0.5,0.9444,1.125,0.5556,0.5,0.2647,2.2778,1.2059,11,French,Sciences de la vie et de l'environnement,Oui,0,0,0,15,Non,1996,M1,22,Anglais,B2,quotidienne,M
cohort_student259,"<p>I did an internship at Carlsberg Laboritory Research in Denmark. My subject was on the dry hopping and  hop breeding. Hops are an aromatic plant and it use on the beer to develop bitterness or to deliver aromatic oil to the beer. Normally, during the beer process, hops is add at the end of boiling step (15 minutes before the end). This method develop a bitter aroma because at this temperature all aromatic oils contains on hops is evaporate.</p><p>Now, the dry hopping consist to add hop pellets during the fermentation step. The temperature is around 15°C and aromatic oils stay on the beer. With this technique, we could create a lot of different taste. There is a lot of hops varietes with unique character.</p><p>The interresting part of this project was to test different hops with different yeast. The fermentation step need yeast who will eat sugar in the beer and producing alcohol. With the dry hopping, we add hop at the same time. During this experimentation, the development of flavor and aroma due to aromatic oil contains in hop pellets was totally different with the different yeast. </p><p>Thanks to this experiment, the best yeast was identifie, the yeast who develop a stronger and good aroma. Because certain yeast develop a bad flavour and taste. Add hops pellets during the fermentation step with yeast permise to develop more aromatic oil contain on hops pellets. This results is really interresting, that means we could use less hops pellets and have the same aromatics oils quantites on the beer, the same flavour and aroma. The price of hops pellets is really expensive (40 euro for 100g and we need 1 g for 1L of beer) so it's a possibility to decrease the price of the production.</p><p>Another good point of this experimentation is the huge possibility to create new flavour and new aroma on the beer. There is a lot of hops varietes and a lot of yeast, we could test a lot of combinaison and discover new flavor. Hops is really an interresting climbing plant and I think it's the future of beer development.</p>",C1,0.512953367875648,0.873150363253815,7.12617593241208,5.03896732573695,18.0178467012955,0.835899011573145,186.045262960079,0.013493091537133,0.0922145118460096,0.235585499773123,4.09402245237573,9.42683506922328,8.55570489604293,58.0512407780013,6.79289067739772,-2.96964575817098,67445492.8135734,50.9415492957746,51.1880281690141,50.1207991549296,9.33065054835267,9.33138028169014,26.6455734406439,8.74494802146211,7.39810409121395,5.64507336561743,85.0420377723971,-329.378483458758,396.964575817098,5.19047619047619,-47.5672938967136,58.1296244131456,6.18722005365527,9.35102615694165,13.1844399731724,6.12839975720993,38.1416666666667,9.6056338028169,8.99619718309859,77.2857142857143,10.8571428571429,40.8484238765929,6.55553252850436,7.27052179745137,6.86345010060362,7.20276391683434,4.04761904761905,1.62484472049689,12.5409005716228,12.1631814264909,12.0237781127736,7.02377811277358,5.56870154258887,6.22651509054326,7.88571428571429,-370.517236083166,-247.545970056338,51.9047619047619,16.9047619047619,1.55492957746479,357,21,41,34,23,8,8,13,58,17,15.5217,10.5,1.619,1.7826,1.4783,0.2353,0.3478,1.0952,0.3478,0.5652,0.3824,2.5217,1.7059,11,French,Sciences de la vie et de l'environnement,Oui,16,4,1,1,Non,1997,M1,21,Anglais,A2,mensuelle,M

Objectives was to test the diminution of pesticides in the field. With my superior and with help of three differents farmers, we tested differents formulations and combinaisons of biostimulant.The elaboration of biostimulants was possible with seewead juice and mineral composition. Seeweads was harvested twenty hours before transformation, they come in brittany's sea. In the field, we experimented four conditions. The first condition was the control (any pesticides and any biostimulants), the second condition with biostimulant, the third with pesticides and last one with combinaison of each produits. We took prelevements and we experimented the grow of plant and leaf and roots. We work with differents crops, for example wheat, corn and barley. On wheat, we observed differents dieases and the objectives of fungicides is to manage the fungus dieases. With experimentation, we took risque to use only biostimulant.</p><p dir=""ltr"">In some conditions, we mesured the photosystem activity of leaves with Spad Meter Material.

Flutter is available on all operating systems (Windows, Mac and Linux) and even on virtual machines (Visual Studio Code and Android Studio).<br /></p><p>It's a great innovation. Now, technology companies will no longer need to recruit android and ios developers  but rather a single developer who can use this tool to produce a robust application, powerful for the various terminals. The best part about flutter is that you have a wide range of widgets beautifully catalogued for you. Not only does it make it hassle-free but also helps you make a functionally amazing app. You use Dart language to write your Flutter app which is compiled to native code and generate ios and android version of your application. Google Flutter is a gift. Eye-catchy interface, faster app development process, flexible APIs  and few more features makes Google Flutter a mobile technology friendly tool.</p><p>The world of mobile development has just cognized a great revolution.<br /></p>",C2,0.642201834862385,0.917754100428055,9.48199646070035,6.70478399654806,28.432499441009,0.898967994665308,127.514518979884,0.00820191941825561,0.0748905518415457,0.187539381922171,5.40383450888663,12.4427887851691,12.0409967656572,64.7974125257277,10.773713613643,-3.39336550535063,100666702.169785,32.1756983240223,33.4131284916201,37.9981748603352,12.6522980955687,12.6531843575419,15.9710144075272,10.393079594237,8.64884869156131,6.56741670352351,79.8571592805543,-399.145020337001,439.336550535064,8.52631578947368,-49.7663066745075,40.2510452807998,7.19374204645692,12.3260188179947,15.4698029991179,7.02123305357248,45.6052631578947,11.7877094972067,11.3964804469274,96.2105263157895,14.9473684210526,49.009703028521,9.43098659217877,9.7782309320788,8.35136183475448,8.7534743310791,5.68421052631579,1.6932380428807,14.172360316639,13.6858683977259,13.5879772930383,8.58797729303831,6.76403440164657,7.50746868568068,9.85263157894737,-433.439943984122,-294.241929944134,85.2631578947368,18.8421052631579,1.74301675977654,360,20,43,31,19,11,10,13,45,18,18.9474,11.6129,1.55,2.2632,1.6316,0.3548,0.5789,0.95,0.5263,0.6842,0.4194,2.3684,1.4516,3,French,Informatique et electronique,Oui,4,1,1,2,Non,1998,L3,20,Anglais,A2,mensuelle,M

cohort_student270,"The computer is definitely the best invention in the technology field. Hundred years ago, people surely had doubted that this invention could have such impact on how the whole society functions, how we as people could interact with each other and how data could be processed and used to take decisions. There is no study field, from medecine to sport or finances, that doesn't require the use of a computer: either for a simple presentation, to financial predictions or to advanced data processing, it has become the main tool. The reason is pretty simple: computers do what people do faster and with a smaller ( or non-existant based on provided data and types of control that have been made) error rate. Not only computers have participated to improving our lifes, they have also opened doors to new discoveries and created new study fields. <p>opinion</p>",B2,0.851351351351351,0.962609681004422,7.32360124086062,5.17856810011875,49.9923982983945,0.939079792754211,182.615047479912,0.00481303221029248,0.0488721687156951,0.141432107892796,6.64227441240788,15.2944020455862,15.5714583333333,71.9875,12.9116666666667,-5.31612795231599,386411839.845853,39.4875,37.2722222222222,42.6160513888889,11.3869814552389,11.3880555555556,19.0585555555556,9.23178555555556,8.03159666666667,7.08323874125874,83.6594925874126,-510.691235319444,631.612795231599,11.4,-59.7829375,40.128,7.43149,14.817,18.4644444444444,9.45736501333333,26.436,10.9375,10.46125,138.2,20,51.7166666666667,9.55737388888889,10.0308544444444,9.51609722222222,10.7201688888889,6.6,1.63623188405797,15.9031890086143,15.3119697385515,15.2474487139159,10.2474487139159,7.10491111111111,8.00535555555556,14.04,-527.973390305556,-260.624031875,114,28.8,1.625,145,6,16,14,6,7,5,4,16,24.1667,24.1667,10.3571,2.3333,2.6667,2.3333,0.5,1.1667,1,0.8333,0.6667,0.2857,2.6667,1.1429,4,French,Informatique et electronique,Oui,144,36,1,10,Non,1991,L3,27,Anglais,B1,mensuelle,M
