14006121,"<p>Modern medical bacteriology has been evolving a lot lately. Even if the most striking invention in the field is the discovery of antibiotics, the bacteria analysis still didn't change since the 70's. However, in the last decade, we could developp new genome-based techniques. In order to simplify the diagnosis and the analysis of bacterial resistance and pathogenesis mechanisms, researchers and pharmaceutical companies from all over the world have spent their time, money and a lot of dedication to these new techniques. Following an example (ISG15 &amp; <i>Chlamydia trachomatis</i>), this short article will present you the guidelines to follow in order to create a technique of this kind.<br /></p><p>At first, you must ensure that the pathology that you want to study is related to a single and specific pathogen (bacteria, ...). Then, an harassing work of molecular mechanisms elucidation needs to be done in order to understand : how, when and why the pathology appears, as well as how can we detect it and how can we treat/cure it. If we already have medicines which may target this microbe, then we may have to use it. Else we have to create a new molecule to fight against the pathogen using the different molecular mechanisms we previously discovered.</p><p>The example I took is an human, innate imunnity-related protein called ISG15 during genital infections due to <i>Chlamydia trachomatis</i>. This protein was thought to have little impact on this bacteria but it has been recently established that it could be an indicator of vaginal chlamydiosis. Actually, this intracellular protein is found in the infected cells at an early stage of infection and in the blood at a later stage. The plasmatic levels of ISG15 could help the diagnosis. The upregulation of this protein may be related to a better recovery of the infection in mice -even if it can't be the only way to cure it.<br /></p><p><br /></p>",10,French,"<p>In conclusion, my personal opinion on the discovery of the importance of ISG15 in <i>Chlamydia</i>-related infections stands in 2 points. Once again, it shows that we can still developp and create anti-infective agents. It is also a quite beautiful proof that modern bacteriology needs to go further and further in the detail when trying to discover a new drug.<br /></p>",Pharmacie,Oui,14,3,10,5,Non,1996,M2,22,Anglais,C1,quotidienne,M,"Thomas Vernay",tvernay,thomas.vernay@etudiant.univ-rennes1.fr,"lundi 8 octobre 2018, 15:54","lundi 8 octobre 2018, 15:54"

I will start by talking about mushrooms as organisms, before presenting mushroom gathering in the forest, and the risks involved in poor mushroom identification prior to consumption.<br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Mushrooms actually come as two forms, a microscopic form and a macroscopic form, that we can see, collect and eat. The microscopic form exists all year long, but we cannot see it. It feeds off decaying plants, like wood and leaves. In Autumn, this microscopic form develops into the stool shaped fruit gatherers collect in the forest. This fruit is in fact there to disseminate spores of the mushroom around the place. We can see the spores under the hat of the mushroom, and they are supposed to be spread around the forest by the wind to give birth to new microscopic mushrooms elsewhere.</p><br /><p>The best period of the year to go looking for mushrooms is in Autumn, after periods of heavy rain, that are very favorable to the growth of mushrooms. The vast majority of interesting mushrooms you can find live in the forest. On a good year, you can find mushrooms from september to january, but sometimes the weather is really good (which means it is bad for mushrooms) and mushrooms will be far more scarse.</p><p><br /></p><p>Any mushroom is said to be toxic if it isn't properly cooked. Some mushrooms that are considered to be edible can provoke stomach aches or diarrhea to certain people, that are too sensitive or that eat too much mushrooms at once. However, if you know you tolerate mushrooms well, there is no reason for you to suddenly become allergic to them. Other than poor tolerance or allergies, mushroom toxicity can be quite severe if ever you don't identify the specie properly and end up eating a mushroom that you believed was edible, despite it being violently poisonous. The main risk in mushroom consumption lies in identification errors. People that gather too many mushrooms too fast are the most exposed to this risk, because they won't necessarily check to see if a toxic mushroom is hidden among similar edible mushrooms in their basket.<br /></p>",12,French,"<p>I think it is a true asset to pharmacists to be recognised as being able to identify mushrooms properly, however it turns out that despite our studies, qualified pharmacists aren't always that well informed about the edibility of a certain common mushrooms.

one hand, this speciality is very important in medecine, because it
helps the clinician to cut of tumor. In fact it will indicate to the
surgeon if he ""kills"" all the tumor. It's now better
because we don't have to make the operation, then verify with a scann
or MRI if the surgeon worked well, and if it's not a good work, call
again the patient to operate another time. </p>

the other hand, anapath can also reserch specific proteins to
see if a treatment will work on a patient. In other words anapath
brings a pronostic. Now a patient can recieve a treatment if we know

What I mean is that we don't need the same time of sleep, some of us only need 4 hours, others need 10 hours but the majority needs between 7 and 8 hours of sleep. That is what is advised by the authorities. Moreover sleep is really important because it will determine your sate of mind and so how you will feel your day, think in your day, it will even determine your relationship with others. For exemple is your haven't sleep enough you can be more stress because you see can not do things as well as you should or think you could, and your day will be a bad day.

we searched about what is happening in the other countries. In Sweden
for exemple, people trust a lot in their doctor and don't put in
reflexion what the doctor say. So, eerybody want to be vaccinaned for
all vaccin, even thoses which are not obligatory. In France, we know
that people are a bit suspicious about their doctor and there is a

It is a concept that tries to modelize a connection between neurones that is created when the brain discovers new things of the world through the eyes, the ears, the proprioception receptors etc.</p><p>The theory of the engram applies that when the brain has to encode new informations from the envirronment it creates connections between neuronal cells by putting in place synapses. </p><p>These synapses exchange informations and electrical potentials by sending chemical molecules. </p><p>Once these molecules have been sent they fix themselves on specifical receptors on the other cell, and that opens a canal into the cell's membrane. These synapses lead neurones to connect and to communicate.</p><p>The association of a specifical number of neurones creates a particular signal that is associated to the perception of one thing in the outside by the brain. </p><p>By example, if a person sees a black cat for the first time, his eyes see it, send a message to the brain that connect its neurones and creates an engram relative to the black cat. </p><p>It has also been proved that these engrams, once identified in the brain, could be controled by laser with a new technic : the optogenetic. </p><p>The laser perturbates the engram signal by stimulating or inhibating the electrical activity, and through this perturbation in a mice brain, the comportment  is also modified. </p><p>For example, if the exeperimentator decides to stimulate the sexual engram by laser, the mice tested that is isolated with another mice will have sudently a sexual comportment.

The main advantage is thair ability to be very specific and therofore to damage only the tumor, while leaving almost untouched the suroundings tissues. Even more, they deliver the medication only when around the tumor, which largely reduce the amount of medication in the general circulation and the amount of sides effect.

Warcraft III is a RTS (real-time strategy) that went out in 2002. It was one of the best game at the time due to a stunning and very rich lore, also the gameplay was really immersive for the year. What is very interesting with the Reforged version is that it will be the same game but, with everything upgraded.

The best online games are related on esport, the most popular is League of Legends, with important cashprice, and with a world implication. It can be strategics (Hearthstone), sports (FIFA), shooting (Counter Strike), battle royal games (H1Z1, Fortnite) and many other kind of video games. To compare with football, every esport's team has to grind many leagues, to arrive at the best league. There is also worlds cup, to continue like the physics sports.

And for some game, professionnal are here since ten years, and it's a big challenge to be a part of them. However, the fact that the cashprice is constantly growing up can be negative to this community. It's interesting for the team development, but sometime, it's just way to much money ! For example, Fortnite. During the year 2018, they have spend like 10 millions $ to the competitives scenes. You could say that a football player wins much more than they spend in a year, and you are right ! But to me, it's too many money.

It can be temperature, humidity, light or the state of something if it is on or off, all the data are collected in one place and have to be process. Currently there are 4 mains problems with the IOT. The first one is the amount of data because there are a lot of data that are collected and we have to treat them quickly. The second problem we have is the latency of the system. It means there are a huge amount of data that we collect in streaming and we have to process them instantaly because we associate a data to a value to know when the data occure. The third problem is the type of the data. There are a lot of type of data, like I said before we have the humidity, temperture, ... These data are some numbers but also there are the states that are boolean (on/off) or the intensity of the light (low, medium or hight).

Cars are way safer than before, especially in slippery conditions or traffic jams with the different driving assistance systems.</p><p>Some boldier experimentations are also driven. For example, some little shuttles are going to be commissioned on campus in just a few days. It will show to the students and staff how could be our future means of transportation on small distances. The manufacturer will be able to test it in real conditions with regular cars driving on the same roads (it is a national first because normally this kind of vehicles are segregated from traffic). They have a very high grade of automation, so if it works well, it will improve the confidence of the public in these technologies.</p><p>One problem that we will have to solve is the legal situation of the autonomous car. Who is responsible in case of an accident ? The car or the driver ? If the car has to made a difficult choice, for example, killing the driver or a pedestrian, what happens ? In France, we don't even have a law that allows fully autonomous cars to be sold to individuals. This will have consequences on our vision of road safety but also our ethics.<br /></p>","Informatique et electronique",Oui,21,5,2,2,Oui,1998,L3,20,Anglais,C1,hebdomadaire,M,"Emile Georget",egeorget,emile.georget@etudiant.univ-rennes1.fr,"mardi 13 novembre 2018, 20:38","mardi 13 novembre 2018, 20:41"

16021826,"<p></p><p>So the disrupting technological advance in my speciality( computer science) is I think the new technology that we call the « blockchain » . It is fairly new and the vast majority of people don’t really know about it. Blockchain is the main technology behind most of the cryptocurrency that are built today. </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>What is a crypto currency you may ask ? Well you certainly may have heard about bitcoin, now or before (and you will certainly heard about in the years coming). Bitcoin is the first crypto currency based on the blockchain technology that was created by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008. </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It seems quite incredible, but before bitcoin we didn’t have « virtual money ». We didn’t know how to send money from one person to another. From a point A to B. And that’s what bitcoin does. The great thing is there is no need to go through an intermediate like banks or government. The bitcoin network is truly decentralized which means that at least you take control of all the computers on earth, no government can shut it off. </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Bitcoin first solved a main problem in the computer science field named « Byzantine fault tolerance ». It is basically solving trust issues. How do you trust a system knowing that people will maybe try to lie to you ? </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In the Byzantine problem, we have commanders outside of a city, that they must overtake. The commanders can only communicate oraly or by sending message to each other. But the problem is the messengers can lie. So how do you make a satisfeasible plan, knowing that some may lies ? </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Bitcoin solved this problem by creating the blockchain, a very big register where all the transaction are listed. And with the miners(people who uses computer to power the bitcoin network) all the transactions made on the network are verified. So there can be no fake transaction. </p><br />",15,French,"There will be real consequences in the real world. Well bitcoin is the first of it's kind and has many drawbacks. It's like the myspace of social network or the emule of p2p. Cool but sadly determined to disappear. <p><br /></p><p>Bitcoin was started on 2008. And to verify the big register file of all transactions, there are miners that use their computer hashpower to resolve problems and run the network. This is called the proof of work. The problem is we didn't know it will be so successful and bitcoin consume a LOT of energy/electricity. If the network was a country it would be the 42th country, that consume the most electricity right between czech republic and switzerland. </p><p><br /></p><p>This is a great drawback and people are trying to find alternative. The another drawback is that if someone controls 51% of the network mining power, it is theoricaly possible to corrupt the network and create false transactions. So literally creating bitcoin ""out of nowhere"". </p><p><br /></p><p>If we want to be truly visionary we can imagine a future where fiat money(dollar, euro) will disappear and let the place to crypto currency. It might take 10-20 years maybe, but it is definitively possible. The proof of work, which is one of the main problem will soon be solved by the proof of stake concept which is more efficient and cost less energy. </p><p><br /></p><p>Children(!) in sweden, norway or even israel are already familiarised with cryptocurrency and they no longer ask for money at christmas but for bitcoin or other cryptocurrency. </p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p>","Informatique et electronique",Oui,0,0,0,5,Non,1997,L3,21,Anglais,C1,quotidienne,M,"Abrar Khan",16021826,abrar.khan@etudiant.univ-rennes1.fr,"vendredi 16 novembre 2018, 09:58","vendredi 23 novembre 2018, 09:30"

When you start a new game, you have to choose the game parameters, like the leader you are going to incarne, the type of map or the difficulty of the AIs.

With you steller you have to create your first city witch is going to be your capital. With a city you can start technologie recherche, cultural expansion, build units or batiments. Then you can reach the victory by five differents ways, military by capturing all the capitals of the others players/AIs, technologie by being the first to send humans to Alpha Centauri, cultural by being so attractive than all the others countries citizens adopt your way of life, diplomatic by being elected world leader at the ONU, points but it is boring and can be desactivated.</p><br /><p dir=""ltr"">To make it more consistent : in this game you have to lead your people and your country throw the ages to make them survive and prosper, and become the most important nation in the world.</p><p><br /></p>",9,French,"<p> The game I just talk about probably didn’t had any consequences at the international stage.

where seeds or any kind of onion’s tissues could grow and differenciate into a
new clone plant identical to the initial plant we used. First few weeks were
reading papers and finding informations about the experience, how scientists
already did it, even on another vegetable and how much time and money it costed.
Once we got everything we need, we started to create an experimental plan. We
created 6 culture medium with different concentration of hormones,
macroelements, microelements and vitamins. Then, we took some Onion’s
inflorescence and put it on the medium we made just after disinfected it. After
2 weeks of development, we were able to see cell clusters called
""cal"". We transplanted the explants onto fresh culture media, and
waited one month in the hope of obtaining a differentiation of the previously
obtained cells into tissues. After a few weeks, we could see buds. This was a
sign that the experiment was working, and that we would obtain plants from the
culture of the differentiated onion inflorescence tissue. To be honest, it was the

<p>The transposable elements (TE, or more commonly called transposons)
are mobile DNA sequences of variable length. The structure of a transposon is as
follows : a central sequence is delimited at each side by repeated (identical) sequences.
They can be classified into two main classes regarding the nature of those repeated
sequences : (1) the DNA transposons which are delimited by terminal sequences orientated towards the same direction, and (2) the retrotransposons, for which the terminal sequences face each other. The difference between the DNA transposons and the retrotranposons also resides in the way they move in the genome. While the first ones move following a cut-and-paste process, the second ones are transfered to other regions of the genome following a copy-and-paste process.</p><p>The TEs can also be distinguished based on the content of their central sequence, which conditions their ability to move autonomously or not from their initial locus to a new one.</p><p><br /></p><br />",11,French,"<p>The discovery of the TEs in the maize genome by Barbara McClintock represents a great step forward into understanding the structure and dynamic dimension of the genome.

Indeed, the TEs make up for 50% of the human genome, and can represent up to 85 % of the big genomes of cereals. </p><p>Moreover, the dynamism of the TEs has surely played (and will keep playing) a great role in the evolution of species.

water but not the aspirin so we just have to put water inside our balloon and
then all the liquids up is water plus acetic acid and all the liquids down
contain the aspirin (in a liquid form). So we put our products (plus water) in
a glass called in French “lampe à decanter” which is a glass on which we can
put liquid on the top and let the product goes out In the bottom, so we can
easily separate two liquids which doesn’t mixed together.</span></p>

heating and put our balloon in ice immediately to stop the reaction. This step
will makes the aspirin cristalize which means that the product is pure enough to

18007729,"<p></p><p>During this year’s first semester, me and a classmate chose a topic related to  materials’ evolution through the ages, for a project on one of our Engineering classes.</p>
<p>Since the early 1900s, men were driven by the idea of being able to fly, and since then, the design and the mechanics of airplanes has changed and evolved exponentially.</p>
<p>The very first airplanes that were designed were inspired from the famous “First Flight” prototype built by the Wright Brothers, Kitty Hawk, the first powered aircraft. These planes were all made of wood, because of his incredible resistance and thickness; although through the years the goal set by aeronautical engineers, was to improve the capacities of the aircraft, reduce fuel consomption and more importantly, reduce the weight of the aircraft.</p>
<p>Weight plays a very important role in the aerodynamics of an airplane: if the aircraft is too “heavy”, it would require more energy, therefore more fuel, in the more demanding phase of a flight: the takeoff.</p>
<p>Thanks to the advanced technology and the work of brilliant engineers all over the world, the aircraft industry was able to find a way of developing “mixes” of different elements in order to obtain different properties from different materials. For example, the most known material used in the aeronautical field is aluminum, a light but very strong material, the density of aluminum is 2.7, as in it is 2.7 times more dense than water. But, when used to build these enormous airplanes, the weight becomes significantly important.</p>
<p>Which is why, engineers started to develop composite materials. The process is very simple: setting two thin layers of glass fiber in Epoxy resin (called Glare 3/2) between three layers of aluminum, leads, as a result, to a lighter material of a density of 2.34.</p>
<p>This is one of the many ways engineers of companies like Boeing are able to improve the characteristics of aircrafts. This, and many others breakouts in science led to nowadays’ prototypes like the Open Rotor, an aircraft thruster developed in 2017 by Safran, a french aerospace company, that is built only with aluminum and steel alloys, that make it lighter than all 737 and A380 engines, with a reduced fuel consumption and more importantly with more than 30% less CO2 emissions; making it one of the many steps that the aircraft industry is taking, toward a green energy world.</p><br />",14,Italian,"<p></p><p>This project made me realize how much i am interested and invested in the engineering world. Because one of the many qualities that an engineer mind must have, is to be able to think outside of the box and to have a large imagination, cause these kinds of ideas are the ones that at first are thought of as impossible or even laughed at; but in the end they are the solution to a better world.</p><p>Just look at Elon Musk for example, he went from ending up in debts because of his ""meaningless"" investments, to being one of the most recognized brilliant minds of our time.</p><br />","Sciences et proprietes de la matiere",Oui,0,0,0,11,Non,1999,L2,19,Anglais,C1,quotidienne,M,"Saad Kafahi",18007729,saad.kafahi@etudiant.univ-rennes1.fr,"vendredi 22 mars 2019, 12:45","vendredi 22 mars 2019, 12:45"

Aspirin synthesis</b>  
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>  The aspirin is a
medicine and its synthesis is important for the pharmaceutic
industry.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>  The mechanism of
this synthesis is quite simple but it require heat and light.</p>
<p>The first step is to
create a phenol with as reactive a benzene. The phenol is a benzene
who has an alcohol function on one of its carbon. This reaction is
hard so we need to synthesis the cumene first and then we had the
phenol. The step two is an aromatic electrophil substitution between
the phenol and a dibrom. Then we use magnesium, carbon dioxide and
water and the product of these multiple addition is a benzene who had
an alcohol function and a carboxylic acid function on two of its
carbon.  This reaction take place in an acid space. 
</p>
<p>With these steps we
have synthesized the salicylic acid.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p align=""left"">  The
last step of this synthesis is the reaction between the salicylic
acid and an ester (the acetic anhydride). For this reaction, we put
both of the reactive in a balloon and we heat the balloon at the
temperature of 55 °C. When we heated the solution, there is a gaze
formation and we used a reflux heater for transform the vapor in
liquid. Then we put the balloon on the ice and we filter the product.</p>
<p>The last manoeuvre
is purification and for that we put with the product ethanol and
water. After we heat again and we filter the melange. The final
product is a white powder who is called aspirin.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>  The aspirin is
used in our everyday life’s. You can take it when you had a
headache or a stomachache or when you are in physical pain and you
need to feel a little better.</p>
<p>This medicine is an
inhibitor molecule and its replace the nor-adrenaline in the synapse.

pain free for couple hour.

an experiment which was realized years ago. This experiment is about
the duality of the light which can act like a particle or a wave.
Until the discovery of this duality, people did not understand the
way light behaved. This experiment and the results the scientist
observed made possible the comprehension of some phenomenon related
to the light. 
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>First, we can talk
about the experiment which was made. This experiment some scientist
realized was Young’s. It was a really simple experiment because
they just made light going through two little gap and they observed
that the light did not behave as expected. Also, the two gap were
separated by a larger space (if they had not, the experiment would
not had worked). Besides, the two gap needed to be really tiny to not
let pass to much light or it would not had been possible to observed
anything. Scientist discovering that light could comport as waves or
particles was a really big step ahead to understand a lot of
observations made in the past which were impossible to even believe
because light has in the same time properties of waves and particles.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>After they made this
experiment, they observed a spectrum designed on the screen behind
which one was created by interferences. Some of these interferences
were called constructive and others, on the opposite, destructive
because the first one permitted to see the light on the screen when
the second kind of interferences let a black screen. These
interferences are observed because of the difference of vibration
between two « wave » of light when it goes through the
different gap because after, there are two part of light which can
interfere.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In conclusion, we
can say that there are no direct applications of this discovery but
it permitted to understand better the way that light was acting and
also a lot of phenomenon which are linked to the way that light
behave.</p><br />",10,French,"<p></p><p>In my opinion, there
are no direct applications of the discovery of the wave-particle
duality but, it permitted understand how light was acting and, this
can be used to define and explain a lot of things which can be useful
and used in every day life. Maybe it is not the most useful discovery
human made but, it is one of the most important anyway. Besides, that
is possible that in the future, this discovery will be used to make
something useful for every day life.</p><p></p><p>We made this
experiment in class, Young’s, to see the same phenomenon scientist
observed and then, we talked about the different kind of
interferences. I do not think it was very useful to make this
experiment except to see what scientist did in the past and why, in
the first place, they did not understand what they observed because
they did not know about this duality. But, because there
are no direct applications of this discovery, we did not see anything
about what we could do with this so, I think that is why I do not
believe that, for now, it is really useful.<br /></p><br /><br />","Sciences et proprietes de la matiere",Oui,1,0.25,1,1.5,Non,1999,L2,20,Anglais,B1,jamais,F,"Karine Lemaitre",18000512,karine.lemaitre.1@etudiant.univ-rennes1.fr,"vendredi 22 mars 2019, 12:53","vendredi 22 mars 2019, 12:53"

performance of cargoes. The problem that they had to solve was
because of the contact between steel, sea and oxygen, it creates
oxidation. They created an anode, made of zinc, which protects the

<p lang=""en-us"" xml:lang=""en-us""><br /></p>
<p lang=""en-us"" xml:lang=""en-us"">	First
of all, we have to have a look on the reactions. Steel is commonly
named with its atomic symbol: Fe. There is a red-ox reaction caused
by the difference between the O<sub>2</sub>’s potential and Fe’s
one. In that way, we have: Fe → Fe<sup>2+ </sup>+ e<sup>- </sup>
and O<sub>2 </sub>+ H<sup>+</sup> + 4e<sup>-</sup> → 2H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>

the fact that sea water is salted, there are the ions: Na+ and Cl-.

oxidation of Fe becomes more important.

it protect our steel?</p>
<p lang=""en-us"" xml:lang=""en-us"">Zinc
(Zn) has a smaller electric potential than Fe. Indeed, in red-ox, the
oxidant “attacks” the reduction which has the most negative
potential. Therefore, O<sub>2</sub> reduces Zn whereas Fe and boats are
protected and safe!</p>

end of Middle-Age, Alchemistry was a wide spread trend. People
apprehended matter as divided into four categories (or elements),
distinct one from the others. They distinguished “water”,
“earth”, “fire”, and “air”. It was impossible to pass
from one to the other, unless we used what people called a
Philosopher Stone. Only this could allow you to turn something from
one element into an other. Obviously, everyone wanted to discover
this very special stone. In fact, it could not only transform silver
in gold, but it could also heal any illness. It was a very valuable
thing, but at the end, no one found the recipe and it became a

of putting a tree into a pot, and watering it. He started his
experiment, assuming that water was of the “water” element, and
the tree was of “earth” element since once it dies, it turns into
dirt. That being set, he measured the weight of dirt in the pot, the
weight of the tree itself and the amount of water he put everyday. I
can’t recall the exact numbers, but after 5 years, he stopped the
experiment, and measured again. The dirt in the pot was of almost the
same weight, he had used a lot of water, and the tree had grown a
lot, but not enough to meet with the weight of water used. He proved
thereby the existence of what he called “Sylvester gas”, and
destroyed the theory of matter divided into four elements. It was the

During these last few years
environment has taken a bigger place in our lives and this is one of
the main challenge the world has to face in the future. In the same
time the growth of the world’s population and  the travelling
people around the world, push developers to explore different kinds
of transports. How can we combine these two areas ? The Solar
Impulse is one first step in what we can do with environment and
transport.</p>
<p lang=""en-gb"" align=""left"" xml:lang=""en-gb"">
<br /></p>
<p lang=""en-gb"" align=""left"" xml:lang=""en-gb"">
First of all, the first prototype of
Solar Impulse was released in 2009. The main goal for its creators
was to built a plane entirely autonomous in energy. The pane does not
need any fossil fuel to fly, but only the energy offered by the sun.
To convert this solar energy (radiation) into electricity, the wing’s
plane are recovered by solar panels made of silicon. These wings are
made of different layers. The photons presents in the sun radiation
interacts with the electrons presents in the layers. Thanks to an
intern process electricity is created. Finally, create electricity is
not that hard ; but to being able to fly a long distance, the
plane needs to create electricity in mass.</p>

<p lang=""en-gb"" align=""left"" xml:lang=""en-gb"">
<br /></p>
<p lang=""en-us"" align=""left"" xml:lang=""en-us"">
In addition of producing electricity
the plane has got an other challenge to face : autonomy which is
directly linked to safety ; of course we do not want the plane
to be forced to land in the ocean or in the Houston as the captain
Sully did in 2009. At the beginning, the Solar Impulse could made
only short travels and mostly during the day when there is more sun.
It is true that they had to find a solution to being able to fly
during the night when there is no sun at all. After few tries they
decided to add big batteries (four) on the wings to stock the energy
produced during the day but not used. That way they achieved their
first world’s tour in July 2016. Finding a plane able to travel all
around the world in an ecological way is  a real breakthrough. The
next step today will be to built a Solar Impulse for commercial
flight.</p>

The problem today is that commercial
planes are bigger and bigger and the rapport of their weigh and their
surface is to short. In fact, if we want to transport as many people
as in actual commercial flight, the future solar plane will need a
huge surface to welcome a lot of solar panels. Of course such a weigh
(plane and passengers) needs a big quantity of energy. Today all
these challenges are not compatible and developers need to find THE
idea which can change the future. As an aeronautic fan, I am looking
forward for that day.

practical classes of physics. An experiment to understood this
abstract concept is the analysis of light using diffraction. It is
based on the fact that lights rays are emit by atoms when they
desexcites, liberating energy. It goes to a final quantum state of
energy from an initial quantum state and free energy under the form
of a particle of photon, which is a no mass particle.

purpose of the experiment is to use the diffraction of the light
emits by a hydrogen luminescent tube to find the quantification
states of the hydrogen atom for each quantum number. This technique
involve a goniometer, which is a device that diffract light with a
network and then gives us the angular diffraction of fundamental rays
of this particular light. Furthermore the atoms are excite by an
electrical field, it passes in the tube filled with gaze of the
element we are working on and by giving energy to them as so
detestation appears as they cannot stay excite.</p>
<p lang=""en-us"" xml:lang=""en-us"">First
to start on the hydrogen state of energy we need to find a crucial
parameter: the number of string of the network that diffract the
light. So we know the light rays he emits by the mercury element and
can retrace their wave length, we are using a mercury luminescent
tube to determine the parameter. Thanks to a physical formula
including this wave length, the number of string and the sinus of the
angle of the diffracted light obtained by the goniometer, we are able
to approach this number and continue the experiment.</p>
<p lang=""en-us"" xml:lang=""en-us"">In a
second time, we replace the mercury tube by a hydrogen one and repeat
the process through the goniometer. At this time we are just able to
pick up the values of the angle of the rays and using the same
formula as the first part of this experiment we can calculate the
final wave length.

other formulas of physics help us is our research of the values of
energy as well as Energy=(Plank constant*speed of light)/wave length.

She was surprise because she had variola and had a lot of scars because of the desease. She noticed that this children wouldn't get variola. She brought this invention in Europe. We call it variolation.</p><p>Few years later, an english man, Edward Jenner, observe that some people did'nt get variola : the cowherd. They were in touch with the cow, and Jenner concluded that the cow was the solution : the virus of the cow was called the vaccine, and he could prevent cowherd from the variola.

Develop by two young Californians engineers, Alfred Luke and Jeremy Germanik, the program is a list of questions who check the probabilites of a disease. For example, if a doctor have a patient with a dyspnea, the doctor can check the case of the dyspnea and the computer displays the probabilities of a cardiological problem and a pulmonary problem ! This invention permits to all people in medecine to hope a future with less errors of diagnosis, and a semiological learning simplify by this help.

This innovation allows also medicine to open window on the future : if we include informatical program in our practise, we can share lot of information between us, increase our mutual experience who prepare us to more different cases of diseases.

17008489,"<p>I am going to talk about test tube baby. Nature gives us the possibility to reproduce ourselves, but we found a way to introduce science in the reproduction syste for those who have diseases. Science can offer the possibility for sterile people to have children, but how is it possible? I will take the example of the test tube baby.</p><p>For the test tube baby, we collect spermatozoons from the male body, and ovums from the female body. We put the ovum on a flat surface and the spermatozooms around, and let the processus happens by itself. The spermatozooms will meet naturally the ovum and only one will penetrate inside it. The fecondation will start. Then, you transplant the embryo in the female uterus ; the pregnancy may start. </p><p>It takes 9 months as every woman, and a baby is born at the end, with no aftereffect. The first test tube baby was born 40 years ago, Louise Brown. She is still alive and feels extremely good, as every human in good health. </p><p>But to give birth in general, we have many solutions, some are ethically correct, others are not. For instance, we can introduce spermatozooms directly in the uterus of the female without taking ovums from her. The test tube baby is for women who have problems with their fallopian tubes. </p>",10,French,"<p>But the question of giving an opportunity for sterile people to have baby in a such easy way creates debates within the population. </p><p>Some people think it is a good thing to help these people. They consider sterile people as sick people who need to be cured. </p><p>But others do not have the same advice. For them, things that we can do do not mean that we have to do them. And it goes against nature to give birth so easily, against the process of reproduction which is the basis of nature. And it causes a problem about the child that is about to born : during the experiment, is he a human already, or not? How should we consider him? </p><p>We are now able to freeze embryo and can use them after a long amount a time. But is it really ethic? Same question : is the embryo a human or not? And if one of the parents die, how do we have to consider it? Is it still the other parent's possession? </p><p>Giving birth with science is a wonderful thing that may help thousands of couples who suffer from sterility, but it causes numbers of ethic problems, and I think we should never consider this as a acquired discovery ;it is new and we should be careful about it.</p>",Medecine,Oui,6,2,5,8,Oui,1998,L2,20,Anglais,B2,hebdomadaire,M,"Augustin Ducasse",17008489,augustin.ducasse@etudiant.univ-rennes1.fr,"mardi 9 avril 2019, 12:09","mardi 9 avril 2019, 12:09"

18003480,"<p>More than 15 % of Oxford University students' use smart pills without prescprition. You might thus ask yourself why they are used and what their risks can be? </p><p><br /></p><p>To begin with, students use those drugs to boost their mental capacities and stay awake for longer. These drugs used are normally prescribed to people suffering from ADHD, narcolepsy or even dementia. They are proven to work on these sock patients by making narcoleptic pateints saty awake for longer for example. However, no study has shown that they could boost healthy people's energy. It has even been proven that they could impair  rather than boost mental performance. </p><p><br /></p><p>Secondly, smart pills have many side effects. Amongst those are seizures, loss of appetite, depression and many more. One of the worst ones is addiction. In fact, students using smart drugs are more likely to use other highly addictive and illicit drugs. It is very hard for students using those brain enhancers to withdraw them and most of them need help ffrom doctors to do so. Moreover one of the major risks of smart drugs is intercations since most students buy smart pilss illegaly and thus get no supervision form doctors. SInce they have no supervision, most of them are not aware that for instance alcohol and contraceptives cannot be taken with those smart pills. Since people taking brain enhancers are mostly students, they are very likely to be taking alcohol regularly as well as contraceptives. Finally, insomnia is a long term side effect of these drugs. Since the brain consolidates memories, creates new brain cells and cleans toxins away during our sleep, insomnia is derimental to brain health. </p>",10,French,"<p>I think smart pills are very dangerous because of all the side effects they can cause. Moreover, its is not even proven that they help with studying for exams, which is why they are taken by studnets. they cause more harm than good. Not only are they dangerous for your health but also for your safety. since those drugs ae bought illegaly, you could get some problems with the police. You can get up to 5 years of jail in the UK. Finally, I am against those smart pills beacuse they create inequlities amongst students. Brain enhancers are quite expensive, not all students can buy them. The main problem is that people that would not normally take those pills are gonna feel like they need to take them to stay competitive since many other people are taking them. Therefore smart pills are dangerous, create inequalities and people feel the need to take them because of others taking them to stay competitive. </p>",Medecine,Oui,8,2,6,10,Oui,2000,L2,18,Anglais,C1,quotidienne,F,"Celeste Cabotte-Carillon",18003480,celeste.cabotte-carillon@etudiant.univ-rennes1.fr,"mardi 9 avril 2019, 12:10","mardi 9 avril 2019, 12:10"
